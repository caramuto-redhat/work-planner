This token: `tenantaccess-contcert-deployment-automation-sa-token-54r4p` does match
[2024-11-07T16:12:37.805639] Ryan Smith: My assumption is that in this `describe` output, all tokens from history are shown
[2024-11-07T16:12:55.553349] Ryan Smith: And the last one is latest, which matches what's in `oc get sa -o yaml`
[2024-11-07T16:21:51.931029] Hubert Stefanski: completely lost as to why that happened :thinking_face:
[2024-11-07T16:22:12.224669] Hubert Stefanski: I guess maybe we can ask Eitan on Monday if he accidentally rotated it with the runner work he's doing
[2024-11-07T16:22:35.990709] Hubert Stefanski: but that's a different tenant all together hmmmm
[2024-11-07T16:40:00.478429] Ryan Smith: Let me ask IT cloud - maybe they auto-rotate
[2024-11-07T16:58:38.560559] Ryan Smith: cc: <@U04HK2W8NGL> ^^
[2024-11-07T16:58:47.564749] Marcin Sobczyk: gdmit...
[2024-11-07T16:59:40.765929] Marcin Sobczyk: just pushed my MR and I was hoping to see the pipeline results :slightly_smiling_face:
[2024-11-07T17:02:02.530949] Ryan Smith: Why did yours pass :thinking_meow:  did someone secretly rotate the token in CI/CD variables?
[2024-11-07T17:02:18.234269] Ryan Smith: Eh, fudge it. I won't mess with that right now while we get that MR merged
[2024-11-13T13:48:00.954859] Juanje Ojeda: <@U02DXVBD5CP> <@U0171SJF00H> FYI, I did a small change to the webserver.
[2024-11-13T16:21:23.618249] Kanitha Chim: does anybody know this repo <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/demos/ces2025-vector-demo>?
I was asked to create a main default branch
[2024-11-19T13:45:11.415589] Marcin Sobczyk: Hi, I've rebased <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/infrastructure/-/merge_requests/370|my MR> in the `infrastructure` repository and CI is <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/infrastructure/-/jobs/28996744|crying about some auth stuff>. Is this a known issue? <@U0171SJF00H> :meow_pwettyplease:
[2024-11-19T13:46:36.500619] Hubert Stefanski: We hit that a few times yesterday, no apparent root cause ;/
[2024-11-19T13:46:47.204719] Hubert Stefanski: re-running it a few times made it pass eventually
[2024-11-19T13:47:58.084689] Hubert Stefanski: It inherits the docker auth config from pipe-x <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/groups/automotive/pipe-x/-/settings/ci_cd>
[2024-11-19T13:48:16.718039] Hubert Stefanski: that has permissions to automotive-toolchain and auto-fusa
[2024-11-19T13:48:39.085319] Marcin Sobczyk: ack, will retry, thanks!
[2024-11-19T14:13:30.814939] Hubert Stefanski: <@U04MGT65NQJ> do we have our own runners enabled for the infra repo? :thinking_face:
[2024-11-19T14:13:40.497099] Hubert Stefanski: seems like this one is just using the release runner for whatever reason
[2024-11-19T14:14:58.164559] Juanje Ojeda: We had that issue already with the tacocat image :confused:
<https://issues.redhat.com/browse/VROOM-24342>
It was affecting more runners, not just ours.
[2024-11-19T14:15:39.662489] Juanje Ojeda: I worked around for a bit changing the pull-policy on the runner, but it was causing other issues
[2024-11-19T14:18:46.091409] Juanje Ojeda: <@U04HK2W8NGL> sort answer: it's a known and annoying issue. but AFAIK, it wasn't affecting the infra repo, tho :thinking_face:
[2024-11-19T14:58:35.797419] Ryan Smith: This quirk seems to be a lot more common since I updated DOCKER_AUTH_CONFIG to include auths for both `<http://quay.io/automotive-toolchain|quay.io/automotive-toolchain>` and `<http://quay.io/auto-fusa|quay.io/auto-fusa>` even though this is valid w.r.t. the auth schema
[2024-11-19T15:07:06.331739] Juanje Ojeda: Yep. And I tested that config inside a container to be sure that I wasn't using any local config and it works as expected :confused:
But for some reason, it doesn't work fine at the runners. (ours or the instance runners)
[2024-11-19T15:09:33.905219] Juanje Ojeda: What is more confusing is that now it worked....
```Authenticating with credentials from $DOCKER_AUTH_CONFIG
Pulling docker image <http://quay.io/automotive-toolchain/infrastructure:latest|quay.io/automotive-toolchain/infrastructure:latest> ...
Using docker image sha256:a2c43abcd6364aa545a058d4520e9214a1bf05c836b6522391194b9321c9f42e for <http://quay.io/automotive-toolchain/infrastructure:latest|quay.io/automotive-toolchain/infrastructure:latest> with digest <http://quay.io/automotive-toolchain/infrastructure@sha256:f7bea158190a69c6599718f62d3318cd94f448114380b4b18f2d00083a8250ee|quay.io/automotive-toolchain/infrastructure@sha256:f7bea158190a69c6599718f62d3318cd94f448114380b4b18f2d00083a8250ee> ...```
It was using our runner, which doesn't have the workaround (the pull-policy to avoid re-pulling images that already exists) anymore :thinking_face:
[2024-11-19T15:17:06.810649] Ryan Smith: I suppose we could devise an experiment to determine if it's Quay (which Im most inclined to blame) or if it's the runner(s)
[2024-11-19T15:24:58.502669] Juanje Ojeda: I was also inclined to blame quay, but after testing it, I'm not sure anymore. It works fine with my credentials and with the credentials at the CI/CD.
I'm not sure if it's the runners, as it happens in both ours and the instance runners.
I wanted to do some experiments with a simple repo and CI, to be able to experiment more quickly and test different things.
[2024-11-19T17:52:03.187279] Juanje Ojeda: <@U04NNGY4QQ2> <@U02DXVBD5CP> <@U0171SJF00H> Something fishy is happening with the autosd webserver. Apart from the fact that the latest compose has some files mixed (like it didn't sync completely), the bucket show 5 dirs plus nightly.
But the web shows 6 dirs plus nightly.
Any ideas?
[2024-11-20T01:50:47.590799] Michael Ho: Just want to add that I'm hitting the quay authentication issues still on the infra repo:
<https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/infrastructure/-/merge_requests/377>
```ERROR: Job failed: failed to pull image "<http://quay.io/automotive-toolchain/infrastructure:latest|quay.io/automotive-toolchain/infrastructure:latest>" with specified policies [always]: Error response from daemon: {"message":"unauthorized: access to the requested resource is not authorized"} (manager.go:250:1s)```
I had one pipeline that failed 100% consistently (while retrying the jobs). On a new pipeline, one job passed but two still failed..
[2024-11-20T02:19:46.395889] Michael Ho: I'll post it here so people don't miss the discussion I have in the thread above! The DOCKER_AUTH_CONFIG doesn't fully support two tokens for registries sitting on the same domain. I swapped the auto-foa and the automotive-toolchain tokens around to fix the infrastructure repository jobs. But we expect something that used that auto-foa token to break :thinking_meow: I guess the terraform jobs for managing auto-foa validator container image repos.
[2024-11-20T02:21:15.886559] Michael Ho: Fyi, <@U04MGT65NQJ>, my MR to add a new GitLab repo looks like it also would destroy the AWS runners: <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/infrastructure/-/jobs/29018472>
[2024-11-20T12:05:20.813389] Avihai Efrat: Hi <@U04JRTQ4LHK> <@U04AXB4GK52>,
<@U04MGT65NQJ> mentioned we are blocked by the <https://redhat.service-now.com/surl.do?n=INC3064728|gitlab-shared-runners - Artifact upload permission denied issue.>
Also that the url_close WA that was suggested there is not actually working.

Currently this ticket is with priority 5 (WA exist) and I want to reflect and escalate it further so I have 2 options:
• Raise to priority 2 : No WA buisness critical priority
• Raise to priority 3: No WA does NOT block buisness critical priority
What do you suggest we choose and why ?

Also <@U04MGT65NQJ> he will check about old runners that might not have this issue until this is resolved.

Another last Q: What have you been using so far to run the validators on and for how long can you keep using it?
[2024-11-20T12:25:46.194109] Michael Ho: <@U04JDAPLMSN> ^ When you asked about this, what was your expectation? Only do it if it's an easy win, right?
[2024-11-20T12:26:20.059039] Michael Ho: &gt; Another last Q: What have you been using so far to run the validators on and for how long can you keep using it?
We use the gitlab cee shared runners, we can continue to use them, we just wanted to see if we could get better queueing/run speeds on private runners.
[2024-11-20T13:33:21.444039] Ryan Smith: This request is only for CI runners to replace our use of the GitLab shared instance runners for FoA validator project CI. The primary objective is to experiment with dedicated runners and gather data to determine whether using dedicated vs shared runners will improve CI job queuing time.

In short - this is not business critical so Prio 3 at the most imo.

One last point: it seems strange that IT's "gitlab-shared-runners - Artifact upload permission denied issue." experienced when turning on a new fleet of runners as result of an outage is somehow blocking us from turning on a self-managed fleet of runners :thinking_meow:  at the end of the day like Michael said this was meant to be "do it if its an easy win" and so far this has neither been easy nor a win
[2024-11-20T13:56:54.786859] Jochen Breuer: > <@U04JDAPLMSN>
> ^ When you asked about this, what was your expectation? Only do it if it's an easy win, right?
I would replace easy with "reasonable effort". If this becomes a problem, we should run this past Steve to make sure we are not blocking other things that might be more important.
[2024-11-20T14:03:58.016289] Ryan Smith: Yes, reasonable effort is a much better way to say "easy win", thank you for the correction.
[2024-11-20T14:12:47.282309] Avihai Efrat: Thanks <@U04JRTQ4LHK> and <@U04AXB4GK52>!
I moved the <https://redhat.service-now.com/surl.do?n=INC3064728|gitlab-shared-runners - Artifact upload permission denied issue> ticket to pri 3.
Also nudged the assignee in the hope that we will get another WA or help .
[2024-11-20T15:48:09.153119] Michael Ho: gentle ping for review <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/infrastructure/-/merge_requests/377> <@U04AXB4GK52> <@U0171SJF00H>
[2024-11-20T16:10:59.989669] Nisha Saini: Hi All,
For getting the auto-signing we need to get the SOA expedited - I am working with the respective teams. Can the respective SMEs please confirm if the _services (in italics_) still required Or if _*new services*_ added to the below list?
 	 
VHCL-004	rhivos-package-level-pipeline
_*VHCL-006	auto-toolchain-sea-bridge*_
VHCL-007	contcert
VHCL-008	rhivos-product-pipeline
VHCL-009	auto-toolchain-infrastructure
VHCL-012	rhivos-webserver
VHCL-013	AutoSD Product Pipeline
_*VHCL-015	test-console*_
[2024-11-20T16:12:50.251959] Juanje Ojeda: I'd say that `auto-toolchain-sea-bridge` *no*, but `test-console` *yes*.
[2024-11-20T16:13:47.501149] Juanje Ojeda: Well, maybe I spoke too soon... <@U02DXVBD5CP> <@U04JRTQ4LHK> do we need sea-bridge?
[2024-11-20T16:14:31.381069] Kanitha Chim: no we don't
[2024-11-20T16:14:33.456939] Kanitha Chim: :smile:
[2024-11-20T16:15:02.845609] Nisha Saini: Great! 1 less service :+1:
[2024-11-20T16:16:04.247319] Kanitha Chim: thank you, Nisha!
[2024-11-25T12:57:24.702289] Juanje Ojeda: <@U04MGT65NQJ> <@U0171SJF00H> I've noticed a bunch of errors like these (at least from yesterday, not sure if before) with the upstream runners:

[2024-11-25T13:00:38.519089] Hubert Stefanski: <@U04MGT65NQJ> I'm trying to get <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/infrastructure/-/merge_requests/382> in for <@U04Q4USRZTM> to back up the TC DB, but I'm seeing my plan overwrites some fields on the runners, did you add any of these manually? :thinking_face:
[2024-11-25T13:00:46.076599] Hubert Stefanski: don't wanna overwrite your changes if you did
[2024-11-26T11:39:52.698329] Ozan Unsal: <http://GitLab.com|GitLab.com>
Title: Pipeline · Red Hat / Edge / ci-cd / Pipe X / Image Info Generator · GitLab
Any idea why this pipeline is stuck <https://gitlab.com/redhat/edge/ci-cd/pipe-x/image-info-generator/-/pipelines/1559618768> ?
[2024-11-27T10:47:14.610689] Marcel Banas: Hello, I wanted to ask if I can have higher than `Developer` role in <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/downstream-pipelines-as-code|pipelines as code repo> - current justification to access/see CI/CD variables values for fixing one job.
Thanks in advance.
[2024-11-27T13:36:37.489129] Hubert Stefanski: Can we get one more approval here: <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/infrastructure/-/merge_requests/385> ?
[2024-11-27T13:37:11.209869] Hubert Stefanski: This adds the tf-integrations bucket properly, since it was created manually before it got added to terraform it broke the plan
[2024-11-27T15:13:37.752269] Luigi Pellecchia: Hi guys, actually plp timeout is blocking some report upload in polarion.
In my case a test is passing but gitlab job failed due timeout.
Can we extend that to support Renesas performance?
<https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/package-level-pipelines/-/jobs/29214463>
[2024-11-29T14:08:48.800139] Michael Ho: <@U02DXVBD5CP> <@U0171SJF00H> I'd like to change the repo name for one of the foa validators, could I get a review please? <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/infrastructure/-/merge_requests/388>
[2024-12-02T14:40:08.629929] Hubert Stefanski: We finally got a full month view for the recent cost savings :meow_dance:
[2024-12-02T14:40:55.222219] Hubert Stefanski: 
[2024-12-03T02:09:57.894419] Nisha Saini: Hi All, upon running the "weak passwords" report on bitwarden, 1 weak pwd was found. We should change it <@U0171SJF00H> /<@U04MGT65NQJ>
[2024-12-03T02:10:49.744259] Nisha Saini: QQ: how are we managing access in Bitwarden vault? Is there role based access Or some rover group to manage that?
[2024-12-03T08:38:23.551869] Hubert Stefanski: It's managed by rover groups, each rover group gets automatically created when we add `@BW@`  in the notes of the rover group, anyone within that group is automatically added/removed based on their membership status
[2024-12-03T08:38:44.221089] Hubert Stefanski: I think this specific one we use somewhere in the ATC dashboard :thinking_face:
[2024-12-03T10:33:57.003219] Michael Ho: Yeah
[2024-12-03T10:34:01.100739] Michael Ho: It's used to access the news
[2024-12-03T10:34:12.060119] Michael Ho: That password was generated for us btw when I requested it long ago
[2024-12-03T10:34:18.680849] Michael Ho: Not sure it's changeable. It's more a token.
[2024-12-03T15:54:07.820819] Nisha Saini: If we do not need this token anymore we can remove it.
[2024-12-03T15:56:40.276289] Nisha Saini: Another question is related to gitlab runners- IIUC we are only relying on AWS hosted runners because there is currently an ongoing issue with runners on MP+.
1. Do we have any ticket to track the remediation for MP+ runners issue?
2. Do we plan to keep using the AWS runners long term as in till July 2025 Or will move back to MP+ in near future?

[2024-12-03T15:58:16.343619] Nisha Saini: ^asking because AWS based runners are the only few things which are blocking the compliance part for services hosted on gitlab.cee( rest runners are hosted on MP+ & maintained by IT) so no additional steps are required there
[2024-12-03T16:02:12.434589] Michael Ho: &gt; If we do not need this token anymore we can remove it.
If you remove the news thing on the atc dashboard, up to you
[2024-12-03T16:19:32.532189] Robert O'Brien: In <#C04JDFLHJN6|> bookmarks we have links to ATC dashboard and the news page.
I don't think we have so many people using the dashboard, so for me, it appears to be a better option to  remove news from dashboard
[2024-12-03T21:26:32.627669] Avihai Efrat: I think part of having a dashboard is being able to post issues/news clearly there , no?
I think it’s very useful and teams look there for updates and status changes.( we can ask in next open toolchain meetup as well) 

Can’t we change the password and keep the news important dashboard feature?

About not many folks using it I think it’s up to us to point other teams to check the dashboard first or keep it updated instead of announcing in multiple channels but if this password change is not possible then it’s a different story.
[2024-12-03T21:28:53.435769] Paul Caramuto: one is internal (dashboard webserver) the other public (source), right?
[2024-12-04T05:28:32.672699] Avihai Efrat: The news section is on the Red Hed source page (which is internal to Red Hat folks, no public AFAIK)
[2024-12-04T16:12:26.270639] Michael Ho: Hi, can I get a reviewers eye on <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/infrastructure/-/merge_requests/392> and <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/infrastructure/-/merge_requests/391> ?
[2024-12-04T19:12:36.617189] Nisha Saini: Hi All,
From next week we'll scrap p-l-p repo and use test-console, which means the ESS assessments for VHCL-004 are not needed anymore.
We can avoid unnecessary ESS related efforts &amp; policy exceptions if we can get a list of services which will be scraped before the prod date July 2025.

Please let me know, if there any other services <https://spaces.redhat.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=363407648|listed here> which you think is not worth the ESS effort.  :slightly_smiling_face:
[2024-12-04T19:20:14.193669] Juanje Ojeda: I think Sea-Bridge was mention that we don't need it, right?
And I wonder why we have `Pipelines as Code` in the services section and then each one of the pipelines (autosd and rhivos) in the pipelines section.
Isn't it a duplication or we need to declare them as both?
[2024-12-04T19:24:05.926449] Nisha Saini: Yes sea-bridge, &amp; both volumes are N/A,
I am now also marking p-l-p as N/A
[2024-12-04T19:24:48.780979] Juanje Ojeda: Sorry, I mixed the infra repo and the pipelines repo :see_no_evil:
[2024-12-04T19:24:54.227359] Nisha Saini: &gt; And I wonder why we have `Pipelines as Code` in the services section and then each one of the pipelines (autosd and rhivos) in the pipelines section.
Do you mean Infra-as-code?
[2024-12-04T19:25:17.924589] Juanje Ojeda: Yes, never mind, I misread it
[2024-12-04T19:25:40.109289] Nisha Saini: hehe, yeah I ll update the STI related page now.
[2024-12-05T15:49:24.939309] Michael Ho: Hi, could I get some reviews here please? <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/infrastructure/-/merge_requests/391>
[2024-12-06T08:36:50.430719] Luigi Pellecchia: Hi good morning,
I saw some gating request in Test Console yesterday and Simon pointed out those are against the "nightly" image.
We should update it to use the latest-RHIVOS-1
[2024-12-06T08:37:52.421419] Luigi Pellecchia: Moreover I was thinking on adding a job at the gating, before the testing to build glibc from source for all the hws, so we don't have to do that in all our testing.
Probably other packages need the same, but I want to know other opinions about that.

[2024-12-06T11:59:28.793089] Tomas Golembiovsky: It seems we don't have it there yet. But this needs to match the right image, no? So when running tests against Tech Preview we need `RHIVOS-1.0-TechPreview`.
[2024-12-06T12:57:16.307489] Luigi Pellecchia: This is package gating, that happen against the nightly build that now is named latest-RHIVOS-1
[2024-12-06T12:57:42.602859] Luigi Pellecchia: so on a new glibc version, we install the new glibc on top of latest because we don't have yet an image coming with that glibc version

Title: Registering runners | GitLab
Hi <@U04MGT65NQJ> <@U0171SJF00H> :
Can you please confirm for self-hosted gitlab runner registration :
1. We are using auth token as stated <https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/register/>
2. We are auto-rotating those token on regular basis
FYI - <@U020YLADEKA>
[2024-12-12T14:21:39.382359] Eitan Raviv: Hi <@U04AGQD0K8D>, sorry - totally missed this message. We are using an auth token but not rotating it. I added a <https://issues.redhat.com/browse/VROOM-25098|task> to the epic. Also commented on <https://redhat.service-now.com/surl.do?n=INC3278825|INC3278825>
[2024-12-12T15:29:36.955819] Hubert Stefanski: :howdy: can we get one more review for Lev here? <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/infrastructure/-/merge_requests/400>
[2024-12-12T15:42:30.793459] Juanje Ojeda: ```instance_type = "m7i.xlarge"```
:astonished:
[2024-12-12T15:46:19.985599] Juanje Ojeda: <@U0171SJF00H> I'm curious, do you know where the repo for that dashboard is? I can't find it :thinking_face:
[2024-12-12T15:46:55.549819] Hubert Stefanski: <@U04LP69FP6X> <@UJJV82KRP> <@UFB1TK0Q7>  can probably point us to it :sweat_smile:
[2024-12-12T16:14:30.055979] Hubert Stefanski: need to run a quick errand but I'll check on the deployment and update the DNS in ~30 mins
[2024-12-12T17:33:27.515069] Hubert Stefanski: Quick review from anyone here pls: <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/infrastructure/-/merge_requests/403>

[2024-12-12T17:53:33.250259] Hubert Stefanski: thanks <@U02DXVBD5CP>!
[2024-12-12T17:59:23.872319] Hubert Stefanski: for you dashboard folk, `10.60.4.157` is the new IP address
[2024-12-12T18:02:45.387489] Hubert Stefanski: Actually, hat's the same as the old one, it picked up the same IP address :sweat_smile:  (that doesn't happen all the time)
[2024-12-12T18:04:03.016729] Sameera Kalgudi: Yes I was surprised.
[2024-12-12T20:59:16.939609] Hubert Stefanski: <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/infrastructure/-/merge_requests/404>
[2024-12-12T20:59:22.434319] Hubert Stefanski: whoops merge request not found
[2024-12-12T20:59:46.837879] Hubert Stefanski: this should create the iam policies for dashboard people (sorry I need to find a new name for you folks :p)
[2024-12-12T21:00:18.358509] Hubert Stefanski: once that's merged <@U04MGT65NQJ> can you log into the AWS UI and enable console login? so that they can stop/start the instance through the UI?
[2024-12-12T21:00:34.000289] Hubert Stefanski: that will be available regardless through the CLI once we generate the aws access key/secret pair
[2024-12-17T23:23:59.155269] Juanje Ojeda: In case anyone is still around. I have this MR fox fixing one job for the nightly build downstream.
It's an interesting case, as the job only work downstream when it uses our runner (the `release` runner), when it uses the instance runners it fails. Even if they have the `docker` tag :thinking_face:
<https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/downstream-pipelines-as-code/-/merge_requests/431>
The job uses buildah for pulling some images and create a multiarch manifest. I think it fails because the userspaces are not enabled.
[2024-12-17T23:24:56.968609] Juanje Ojeda: For this case:
• our runner: 1
• cee runners: 0
:stuck_out_tongue:
[2024-12-18T10:03:12.710359] Tomas Golembiovsky: yeah, that think does not work with cee runners. Year ago it made our efforts of building multi-arch container a real pain.
[2025-01-09T18:22:21.384509] Ryan Smith: Anyone around that can bestow a second ACK <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/infrastructure/-/merge_requests/413|here>? This project was already archived so this is just getting the terraform plan up-to-date
[2025-01-10T09:41:02.605729] Michael Ho: Can we get another ACK on <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/infrastructure/-/merge_requests/412> ? Would be nice to have this project.
[2025-01-10T09:56:04.108779] Hubert Stefanski: <@U04JRTQ4LHK> happy to approve, but I think you don't want capitilized path names :wink:
[2025-01-10T09:56:24.337869] Hubert Stefanski: the good o'l project name -> path name keeps capitilization, so you'll end up with `gitlab.cee/Binary-Analysis`
[2025-01-10T10:10:48.520339] Michael Ho: nooo
[2025-01-10T12:54:16.662949] Ryan Smith: I don't think this is true
[2025-01-10T12:55:00.746199] Ryan Smith: Either way it won't hurt to put the desired path there explicitly, I'll fix that later
[2025-01-10T12:55:08.950099] Hubert Stefanski: Is that for the terraform provider or for gitlab docs?
[2025-01-10T12:55:37.903939] Ryan Smith: GitLab API
[2025-01-10T12:55:38.080099] Hubert Stefanski: IIRC the terraform behaviour didn't match that of gitlab itself
[2025-01-10T12:55:49.992159] Ryan Smith: Why terraform :facepalm:
[2025-01-10T12:55:56.628529] Hubert Stefanski: terrorform
[2025-01-10T12:56:03.049009] Ryan Smith: Fr
[2025-01-10T12:56:48.423519] Ryan Smith: I'll add the path explicitly, safer that way anyways
[2025-01-10T13:33:22.075529] Michael Ho: We should always set the path explicitly.. so if we copy+paste from another one, we won't forget this again..
[2025-01-10T14:15:36.221839] Ryan Smith: I actually copy/pasted this from one :sweat_smile:
[2025-01-10T14:16:18.193629] Ryan Smith: <http://project_code-review.tf|project_code-review.tf>
[2025-01-10T14:17:26.600399] Michael Ho: Yeah that's what I expected :sweat_smile: cause this happened to me last time from copy+paste
[2025-01-10T14:18:52.240229] Ryan Smith: Path added :muscle:
[2025-01-10T14:19:05.663869] Ryan Smith: !412 is ready for another look
[2025-01-15T13:11:36.696289] Ryan Smith: <@U0171SJF00H> or <@U02DXVBD5CP> have either of you (or anyone else here I didnt tag) seen anything from IT w.r.t. automatic log forwarding to Splunk on MPP coming to an end?
[2025-01-15T13:18:24.588179] Hubert Stefanski: hello, we had this splunk filter which appears to have been working until early December, but no longer returns any of our MPP deployments
````mpp_filter_events_by_cluster(prod-*)` sourcetype=crio "Received pod 'eiam-prod-*-deploy'"```
I see some of the changes to unified logging, but have been unable to determine how to continue viewing those logs. Is there something application side that needs changed, or is there a different splunk filter we should use?

[2025-01-23T07:46:49.401339] Kanitha Chim: <!channel> - Updating Rover Groups

As part of complying with the broader people tagging + agile boards initiative I need to do an overhaul of the rover groups.

I'm going to be deleting some that don't comply with the naming scheme (no ability to rename), and will be creating new groups to match the naming convention and our current team definitions.

I hope this is mostly transparent, but if you've been using the existing groups for repo access or as mailing lists it might throw a wrench in things.

If you anticipate any issues or notice anything weird after please let me know (with an <@U04L9JH51GR>)

New groups I will be creating
• rhivos-ft-fusa-certcore
• rhivos-ft-fusa-assessment
• rhivos-ft-fusa-foa
• rhivos-ft-fusa-infra
• rhivos-ft-release-management
• rhivos-ft-communities
• rhivos-ft-si
• rhivos-ft-aristocats
• rhivos-ft-off-board
Existing groups I will be updating membership
• rhivos-ft-fda
• rhivos-ft-base-os-automotive
• rhivos-ft-auto-toolchain
• rhivos-ft-paw
• rhivos-ft-auto-kernel
• rhivos-doc-team
• rhivos-ft-performance-scale
• rhivos-ft-product-security
• rhivos-uxd
• rhivos-support-team
Items I will be deleting:
• auto-foa-team
• auto-fda-team
• rhivos-communities
• automotive-prodsec
• rhivos-ft-functional-safety
• auto-cats-team
• rhivos-ft-cats
• rhivos-ft-pdr
Known items I'm not touching:
• "auto-kernel" - because its tied to git access
• "auto-sni-team" (yet) - because its a team mailing list - it should migrate to the naming convention compliant "rhivos-ft-si" when possible
Other administration groups that do not relate to the people tagging exercise (that I will not be touching)
• rhivos-managers
• automotive-gigs-rhivos
• polarion-rhel-admins
• rhel-sst-testing-farm
• auto-gitlab-cee-owners
• rhivos-gitlab-cee-owners

[2025-01-23T11:12:48.807379] Avihai Efrat: Thanks for adding it here <@U02DXVBD5CP> !
I hope it will not break anything.

I so for ATC the  group name is the same with updated folks to who we have today in the team to reflect that .
<@U0171SJF00H> do we have any service/automation that require someone specific to be on the toolchain rover group to work that might hint of possible breakage from this change?

[2025-01-23T11:14:12.020779] Hubert Stefanski: We should be fine, the groups that affect things are in Shawn's "will not be touching" section, so we're good

<@U04MGT65NQJ> <@U0171SJF00H> Do you know why this upstream runner takes so long to initiate the job?
<https://gitlab.com/redhat/edge/ci-cd/pipe-x/pipelines-as-code/-/jobs/9039451502>
I stopped it and retried because 8 min in it wasn't even starting the job :confused:
I've seen this a few times in the past.
[2025-02-05T14:21:25.669189] Michael Ho: <@U0171SJF00H> Do you have some guidance/experience with setting up a bot account on <http://gitlab.com|gitlab.com>?
[2025-02-05T14:21:41.090909] Michael Ho: I'd like one to use to generate access tokens for contcert usage.
[2025-02-05T14:25:03.598599] Hubert Stefanski: I'm not sure if this is a "prodsec approved" method, but what I did for the ATC bots was to use one of our team mailing lists with email capabilities enabled to create the account.

Then we just store the password in bitwarden (and you can also enable 2FA through it)
[2025-02-05T14:25:46.638549] Hubert Stefanski: If you wanna go real fine-grained you can set up a rover group for only those that can access it and enable the email capability on that
[2025-02-05T14:26:00.602809] Hubert Stefanski: ATC has a blanket access for upstream auto-bot for all of auto-toolchain-devel
[2025-02-05T14:43:14.177229] Michael Ho: I wonder if we can piggyback on you?
[2025-02-05T14:43:22.128089] Michael Ho: Would you be against letting us share your bot?
[2025-02-05T14:43:34.669019] Michael Ho: It's mainly for read-only purposes
[2025-02-05T14:48:13.094069] Hubert Stefanski: I've nothing against it, just make sure to name the access tokens something that won't easily be deleted :sweat_smile:
[2025-02-05T14:48:22.297499] Hubert Stefanski: you've got access to that BW group still, right?

[2025-02-06T09:13:25.234839] Hubert Stefanski: For everyone's situational awareness: I switched the email address from `<mailto:automotive-a-team@redhat.com|automotive-a-team@redhat.com>` to `<mailto:automotive-toolchain-devel@redhat.com|automotive-toolchain-devel@redhat.com>` and the subsequent e-mails were Michael logging in and setting up some tokens for the Follow-On-Activities team, so no need to worry about the emails on `<mailto:automotive-toolchain-devel@redhat.com|automotive-toolchain-devel@redhat.com>`

[2025-02-10T08:48:06.002679] Michael Ho: It appears to be done via SAML
[2025-02-10T08:49:23.984849] Hubert Stefanski: I guess not, since I get a 404 on that page
[2025-02-10T08:49:49.549769] Michael Ho: Maybe it's by getting package maintainer rights
[2025-02-10T08:51:41.260109] Hubert Stefanski: Do you need access to just one or more repos there?
[2025-02-10T08:53:04.656689] Michael Ho: Would be good to just get the broad rhel access since we might need to access the source repo of any package there
[2025-02-10T08:55:48.488519] Michael Ho: I'm guessing it's because I'm in the <https://rover.redhat.com/groups/group/bugzilla-redhat|bugzilla-redhat> rover group

[2025-02-10T08:57:25.456889] Michael Ho: I'm not sure if we should try sign up the mailing list auto-toolchain-devel in the bugzilla or find another way... but probably it would be fine...
[2025-02-10T09:05:13.503869] Michael Ho: <@U0171SJF00H> Michael Hofmann authored some of that doc, maybe you could ask him for some help? :sweat_smile:
[2025-02-10T09:05:37.968449] Michael Ho: The other authors are Stephen Gallagher, and Veronika Kabátová
[2025-02-10T09:20:52.542649] Hubert Stefanski: Luckily <@U01TD879DV5>  is already in this channel :sweat_smile:
[2025-02-10T09:21:03.956899] Hubert Stefanski: Michael, can you help us out here?
[2025-02-10T15:36:09.339699] Hubert Stefanski: <@U04JRTQ4LHK> once you get the password reset can you update <https://spaces.redhat.com/display/Automotive/General+Purpose+LDAP+Service+accounts> with the bitwarden entry?
[2025-02-10T15:38:06.711429] Michael Ho: of course
[2025-02-11T15:18:48.606099] Hubert Stefanski: Hey folks, Heads up, we got an abuse report from aws

&gt;  Hello,
&gt; 
&gt;  We've received a report(s) that your AWS resource(s)
&gt; 
&gt;  AWS ID: 587138297281    Region: us-east-1    EC2 Instance ID: i-088a197c07574e738
&gt;  AWS ID: 587138297281    Region: us-east-1    EC2 Instance ID: eni-07071fe262c03fd85
&gt; 
&gt;  has been implicated in activity which resembles attempts to access remote hosts on the internet without authorization. Activity of this nature is forbidden in the AWS Acceptable Use Policy (<https://aws.amazon.com/aup/>). We've included the original report below for your review.
&gt; 
&gt;  Please take action to stop the reported activity and reply directly to this email with details of the corrective actions you have taken. If you do not consider the activity described in these reports to be abusive, please reply to this email with details of your use case.
&gt; 
&gt;  If you're unaware of this activity, it's possible that your environment has been compromised by an external attacker, or a vulnerability is allowing your machine to be used in a way that it was not intended.
&gt; 
&gt;  The logs provided in the report(s) indicate your instance has attempted to deliver a malicious payload to our trusted third party reporter.
&gt; 
&gt;  * The "Payload_class" section of the report indicates a known vulnerability your instance attempted to exploit.
&gt;  * The "Payload_data" section contains the base64 encoded malicious payload your instance attempted to deliver.
&gt;  Based on the report, we believe your instance has most likely been compromised or is being exploited by a bad actor.
&gt; 
&gt;  We require one of the following actions to resolve this case:
&gt; 
&gt;  1. If your instance has been compromised we recommend you investigate for any malware, malicious scripts or backdoors, and respond to us confirming that malicious items have been identified and removed.
&gt;  2. If you cannot identify the source of the reported activity the best course of action is to migrate your applications to a new, secured instance, and terminate the reported one.
&gt;  3. If you believe this traffic is intended we will require a use-case that explains why your instance attempted to deliver this payload to the reported target.
&gt; 
&gt;  Please remember that you are responsible for ensuring that your instances and all applications are properly secured. If you require any further information to assist you in identifying or rectifying this issue, please let us know in a direct reply to this message.
[2025-02-11T15:19:41.818789] Hubert Stefanski: Please DO NOT, delete this instance, or touch it, I've stopped it for the time being
[2025-02-11T15:20:35.552719] Hubert Stefanski: From what I can see, the instance was started with <@U02F2L89YTS> keys, but I'm sure Juanje wouldn't be trying to brute force other instances

[2025-02-11T15:21:24.776679] Hubert Stefanski: an instance and a network interface
[2025-02-11T15:22:16.368879] Juanje Ojeda: Hmmmm... that's from today?
[2025-02-11T15:22:29.017119] Hubert Stefanski: It was started on Sunday Feb 9th
[2025-02-11T15:22:39.065639] Hubert Stefanski: assuming you don't work on Sundays :wink:
[2025-02-11T15:22:44.441919] Juanje Ojeda: :see_no_evil:
[2025-02-11T15:23:12.052839] Michael Ho: Sun Feb 09 2025 15:35:23 GMT+0100 (Central European Standard Time) (2 days)
[2025-02-11T15:23:20.029159] Michael Ho: Instance type
t3.micro
[2025-02-11T15:23:20.618779] Juanje Ojeda: I think I started the instance. But I thought I destroyed it. Maybe I didn't :disappointed:
I created another one, but I'm sure I destroyed that other one

[2025-02-11T15:23:39.344309] Juanje Ojeda: Yep, that's the second one I created :confused:
[2025-02-11T15:23:47.952049] Michael Ho: One bad thing: <https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/vpcconsole/home?region=us-east-1#NetworkAclDetails:networkAclId=acl-81df36fd>
[2025-02-11T15:23:56.503329] Michael Ho: the firewall is set to literally open everything
[2025-02-11T15:23:58.534649] Juanje Ojeda: I guess I didn't terminated properly :confused:
[2025-02-11T15:24:34.907229] Michael Ho: <@U02F2L89YTS> does that image have a default password set?
[2025-02-11T15:24:41.250149] Michael Ho: i.e. the root password is password?
[2025-02-11T15:24:55.084209] Michael Ho: I thought we disabled awhile back the default open ssh state of these images...
[2025-02-11T15:25:06.508499] Juanje Ojeda: yes
[2025-02-11T15:25:39.539539] Juanje Ojeda: They shouldn't be able to modify the image (ostree, composefs, signed modules, etc), but they could access with root
[2025-02-11T15:25:58.123879] Hubert Stefanski: yes == we disabled it, or yes == it uses `password`? :sweat_smile:
[2025-02-11T15:26:26.735349] Juanje Ojeda: the second line answer that. Yes is uses password
[2025-02-11T15:26:42.727369] Michael Ho: :meow_crying:
[2025-02-11T15:27:15.243639] Michael Ho: That's a pity.. I know QE found it annoying to not be able to ssh into systems easily but it is such a dangerous thing to do..
[2025-02-11T15:28:34.484569] Juanje Ojeda: the idea was to have the image manifest to be very explicit and avoid to pass many options during build time, to make the images more predictable and reproducibles
[2025-02-11T15:29:15.861759] Juanje Ojeda: Before we add it only for the boards, and not for the AMI. But now that it's in the image definition, the option is for all the images :confused:
[2025-02-11T15:29:28.105959] Juanje Ojeda: Maybe we need to move it back to the build time
[2025-02-11T15:29:34.714559] Michael Ho: :sweat_smile: This could be making the testing-farm open for security attacks
[2025-02-11T15:30:38.617669] Juanje Ojeda: I mean, normally it's not that unsafe, as the instance will be up for a few minutes. But the problem was that I left the instance running a couple of days by mistake :confused:
[2025-02-11T15:31:00.169759] Michael Ho: Yeah but sometimes QE might trigger an instance and leave it running for debug, or long running tests..
[2025-02-11T15:31:10.635409] Michael Ho: And you might be able to jump from one open instance to something else
[2025-02-11T15:31:29.604849] Michael Ho: Even if it's only a few minutes, once someone figures out these instances are coming up and down regularly, they can target them
[2025-02-11T15:31:47.934889] Hubert Stefanski: We'll be moving the specific conversation to <#C08CL3Y7GF8|>, that was set up by the infosec folks for this incident
[2025-02-11T15:31:56.032119] Michael Ho: ack
[2025-02-11T15:33:19.470279] Juanje Ojeda: &gt; Yeah but sometimes QE might trigger an instance and leave it running for debug, or long running tests..
Not really, they don't have aws credentials, so they can't.
[2025-02-11T16:27:35.555419] Juanje Ojeda: This can lead to security issues when running the instances in AWS. There was already an incident. If needed, those options could be added in build...
Title: fusa-minimal/qa: remove the password and root ssh access (!59) · Merge requests · Red Hat / Edge / ci-cd / Pipe X / Custom Images · GitLab
Sorry for the incident and for the noise with the MR to fix the images.
Here is an updated MR for removing the access to the ssh via password. It still allow access as root, because it's how TF access and the public ssh keys are set for that user. But the only way to access to the EC2 instances will be as before, via public ssh keys.
<https://gitlab.com/redhat/edge/ci-cd/pipe-x/custom-images/-/merge_requests/59/diffs>
[2025-02-11T16:42:43.407159] Jochen Breuer: Thanks for the quick fix!
[2025-02-11T16:50:05.899629] Juanje Ojeda: The good thing is that this wasn't used in production yet. We weren't building the fusa-minimal in the pipeline, it was just in a MR, so the impact was minimal (:sweat_smile:).
But at least we detect it before we started to use it for ALL the pipelines every day :sweat_smile:
[2025-02-11T20:02:14.575829] Michal Skrivanek: yay cloud. That's the public ranch? With rhivos image??
[2025-02-12T00:38:19.774859] Juanje Ojeda: It wasn't a public ranch, it wasn't in TF. I create an ec2 instance out of the AMI from the pipeline to test why the smoke-test weren't working on those images.
But it was an autosd fusa-iminimal image.
[2025-02-12T06:35:58.851329] Michal Skrivanek: We still call autosd rhivos? Ok. Best to build as without pwd indeed, but I still think we either should remove it only for aws or remove it for all and e.g. have a devel key documented at sigdocs. 
Otherwise it really is a horrible experience
[2025-02-13T12:22:43.307039] Juanje Ojeda: <@U04MGT65NQJ> did anything change with the rhivos webserver's ssl cert?
From CKI they reported me this error, which they think wasn't before:
```requests.exceptions.SSLError: HTTPSConnectionPool(host='<http://rhivos.auto-toolchain.redhat.com|rhivos.auto-toolchain.redhat.com>', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /in-vehicle-os-9/RHIVOS-1/latest-RHIVOS-1/test_images_info.json (Caused by SSLError(SSLCertVerificationError(1, '[SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed: self-signed certificate in certificate chain (_ssl.c:1006)'))```
[2025-02-13T14:25:40.026809] Juanje Ojeda: <@U04MGT65NQJ> Is anything going on right now with that URL. It's on and off all the time

[2025-02-14T09:59:35.811049] Hubert Stefanski: I yet again, failed to provide the correct url
[2025-02-14T09:59:41.370719] Hubert Stefanski: this one _should_ work
[2025-02-17T11:52:59.130149] Hubert Stefanski: Hi folks, regarding `[AWS-ATEAM-STAGE] Your Amazon Web Services Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Has Been Deactivated External` Was this anyone here? If not I need to escalate this somewhere, that MFA was in our bitwarden, so I'm quite concerned how this could have happened
[2025-02-17T13:02:38.087409] Hubert Stefanski: <https://redhat.service-now.com/surl.do?n=CHG0106915>
this was an expected removal, but I didn't catch any of the communication leading up to it, my inbox has no mention of it.
And apparently we were one of the few accounts that actually enabled MFA for ourselves, so nothing to be concerned about in the end :phew-obama:
[2025-02-18T15:20:51.778869] Hubert Stefanski: <@U04MGT65NQJ>, in your time, could we onboard the gator repo to our custom runners? right now one of the test run pipelines is taking a bit of time, and i'm 99% confident it'll reach a timeout before we get a response from test console with all the results we need <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/fences/gating/gator/-/jobs/31582407>  I believe currently we're limited by the shared runners to 4 hours
[2025-02-18T15:58:53.011169] Hubert Stefanski: ^^ actually, hold on that, I think there might be a better way

Sender: Thread in Slack Conversation
Hi All, looks like we have 2 CMDB IDs for the same service Test Console. Can someone confirm which one should be used? VHCL-015 was created as part of the SOA &amp; ESS coverage. I am not sure when TCA-001 was created.
Cc : <@U04Q4USRZTM>, <@U04QNH25QA1>, <@U02F2L89YTS>, <@U04NHTDFS6P>, <@U020YLADEKA> , <@U04N9LTR47M>
Background: The delegate-owner was updated as part of <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/catalog/catalog/-/merge_requests/7147/diffs#252c6481726b7fc1970762c2e6a999df0a50183c|MR!7147> in Jan, whereas I am still getting Test-Console email notifications. When I checked with the CMDB team they told we have 2 test console applications.
[2025-02-25T17:20:16.566579] Avihai Efrat: I vaguely remember <@U04QNH25QA1> asking for slack or mailing list to notify TC announcements and he might have created another CMDB ID , not sure why.
Maybe <@U04Q4USRZTM> knows more 
[2025-02-25T19:59:44.122629] Luigi Pellecchia: I'm only aware about the TCA-001
[2025-02-25T19:59:53.509789] Luigi Pellecchia: I'll take a look tomorrow and I'll let you know
[2025-02-26T08:12:30.680839] Nisha Saini: <@U04Q4USRZTM>: VHCL-015 was created as part of RHIVOS services. The epic <https://issues.redhat.com/browse/VROOM-24606|VROOM-24606> covers all the RHIVOS services &amp; the <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1J6KqIrTH5aLMhsHKJrXlIm-MfPV_NZgG-ldaSAs0IDQ/edit?gid=0#gid=0|spreadsheet> covers all the details of ESS &amp; SOA. IMHO if the TCA-001 has not started any work then we can remove that &amp; continue to use VHCL-015 because that has all the prodSec work tracked. WDYT?
[2025-02-26T09:55:48.096929] Kanitha Chim: Learn about usage and limits for Docker Hub.
Title: Usage and limits
Are we pulling a lot from Docker Hub? seems they are going to lower the limit per hour
<https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/usage/>
[2025-02-26T09:57:06.788669] Kanitha Chim: already hitting the issue here: <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/services/supply-chain-webserver/-/jobs/31822893>
[2025-02-26T10:03:27.433979] Hubert Stefanski: I _think_ we can mitigate at least part of that by shifting more jobs to the runners that <@U04MGT65NQJ> is provisioning
[2025-02-26T10:03:48.991799] Hubert Stefanski: but, 10 pulls PER HOUR, is insanely low...
[2025-02-26T10:04:10.380739] Hubert Stefanski: I guess we could add docker auth to our runners somehow, and increase that to 100
[2025-02-26T10:04:34.507819] Hubert Stefanski: Which we'd probbaly be good with for quite a while since we don' use dockerhub all that much in our pipelines
[2025-02-26T10:04:43.490919] Hubert Stefanski: except for some lint jobs i.e this one
[2025-02-26T11:01:19.074109] Robert O'Brien: There was a mail on 10 January with subject "[REMINDER - ACTION REQUIRED] Cease use of Docker Desktop and Docker Hub" and a link to <https://docs.google.com/document/d/17rJ8x57ao8wZ3Twyyr3zpBQHStceZXMoLFKfiuBYQw8/preview?tab=t.0#heading=h.v94vn0afrs7p>
Could that be a factor here?
[2025-02-26T11:41:40.897939] Kanitha Chim: yeah it seems that we might have to migrate from Docker Hub
[2025-02-26T11:41:52.533129] Kanitha Chim: thanks <@U02JHD5HMGC> for sharing!
[2025-02-26T12:16:44.983199] Juanje Ojeda: We did move away from DockerHub some time ago. We have some copies of those images in quay. For example, for that job we have this image container instead:
```<http://quay.io/automotive-toolchain/hadolint|quay.io/automotive-toolchain/hadolint>```
[2025-02-26T12:18:11.535659] Juanje Ojeda: I guess we forgot about that repo :thinking_face:
[2025-02-26T12:18:45.120229] Kanitha Chim: yeah I guess so
[2025-02-26T12:19:08.818589] Kanitha Chim: anyway, we can also use google cache, it was recommended in that doc so I updated
[2025-02-26T12:20:49.419619] Juanje Ojeda: I'd use our own images in quay as much as possible. We have more control there and the images are scanned.
[2025-02-26T13:48:04.131689] Hubert Stefanski: ezpz review for anyone :) <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/infrastructure/-/merge_requests/441>
[2025-02-27T08:05:43.928299] Michal Skrivanek: eh, anything going on with aws? dowloading image from <http://rhivos.auto-toolchain.redhat.com|rhivos.auto-toolchain.redhat.com> at 200-400KB/s, from within RH internal network...bleh
[2025-02-27T08:33:00.520469] Hubert Stefanski: Haven't seen anything on my outage/announce lists, must be the server itself...
[2025-02-27T08:33:38.781479] Hubert Stefanski: there's an epic that I want to pick up in the next sprint or two to replace this with a geo-based edge cache through cloudfront
[2025-02-27T08:34:11.589739] Hubert Stefanski: that should be much faster and not rely on any self-managed web servers

[2025-02-27T12:53:42.769639] Juanje Ojeda: I can log in :thinking_face:  (ssh)
[2025-02-27T12:54:41.008369] Hubert Stefanski: What's the instance IP?
[2025-02-27T12:54:57.981159] Juanje Ojeda: 10.30.77.218
[2025-02-27T12:55:38.865689] Juanje Ojeda: did it have a container? I don't see any running
[2025-02-27T12:56:51.068499] Hubert Stefanski: yeah, it should be running one, but I can't find the instance in our account :thinking_face:
[2025-02-27T12:57:30.614749] Juanje Ojeda: I don't see anything weird in the logs, but I don't see the container running...
[2025-02-27T12:58:47.474179] Juanje Ojeda: I started it
[2025-02-27T13:00:23.860879] Juanje Ojeda: It's running, but I can't reach the web yet :thinking_face:
[2025-02-27T13:02:37.725509] Kanitha Chim: wait <@U02F2L89YTS> download mirror doesn't need container
[2025-02-27T13:04:03.104809] Juanje Ojeda: I thought so :sweat_smile:
I remember having the same doubts some time ago
[2025-02-27T13:04:10.162189] Juanje Ojeda: I stopped it
[2025-02-27T13:04:31.719139] Kanitha Chim: so it's not our side, we can't reach this now <https://download.hosts.prod.upshift.rdu2.redhat.com/>
[2025-02-27T13:04:43.469179] Juanje Ojeda: There is some container image there and some commands related to it in the history, but I think someone was testing a container there
[2025-02-27T13:04:54.765419] Juanje Ojeda: Ahhhhhhh
[2025-02-27T13:05:21.828979] Kanitha Chim: let's remove that container to avoid confusion
[2025-02-27T13:05:29.700049] Juanje Ojeda: yep
[2025-02-27T13:38:30.149029] Juanje Ojeda: Is Test Console down? <https://test-console.corp.redhat.com/>
[2025-02-27T13:40:18.533299] Hubert Stefanski: 
[2025-02-27T13:40:37.177009] Hubert Stefanski: I'll address it real quick
[2025-02-27T13:41:53.551509] Juanje Ojeda: Yep, the container image tag is not in quay
[2025-02-27T13:42:44.232039] Hubert Stefanski: hmm, I was checking if the docker auth config got expired or something
[2025-02-27T13:43:07.569279] Hubert Stefanski: yeah, the build is stuck
[2025-02-27T13:43:09.120589] Hubert Stefanski: <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/services/test-console/-/jobs/31871179>
[2025-02-27T13:44:36.167849] Juanje Ojeda: Ouch :confused:
We merged too soon the infra MR :confused:
Next time we need to make sure the TC image is already in quay
[2025-02-27T13:46:13.394869] Juanje Ojeda: It looks like the RH infra problems made the previous job to build the image. It couldn't reach `<http://repository-basic.engineering.redhat.com|repository-basic.engineering.redhat.com>` :confused:
[2025-02-27T13:46:49.381219] Juanje Ojeda: ```NFO[0110] Running: [/bin/sh -c curl -X GET <https://repository-basic.engineering.redhat.com/nexus/repository/dno-raw/droute-client/1.2.2/droute-linux-386>          -o "${DROUTE_PATH}" &amp;&amp;  chmod +x "${DROUTE_PATH}"]

[2025-02-27T13:47:23.600249] Juanje Ojeda: I think it's better to come back to the previous tag until this start to work again and we can build the image
[2025-02-27T13:48:38.538529] Juanje Ojeda: Or we could even use (for now) the tag from the MR: `ride4-inventory-change`
[2025-02-27T13:48:49.013839] Hubert Stefanski: <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/infrastructure/-/merge_requests/443>
[2025-02-27T13:48:52.425169] Hubert Stefanski: if you want to revert
[2025-02-27T13:49:32.565319] Juanje Ojeda: Let's revert it. It's the safest bet for now
[2025-02-27T13:49:45.089479] Juanje Ojeda: <@U02DXVBD5CP> <@U04NNGY4QQ2> could you approve that MR?
[2025-02-27T13:52:01.640129] Hubert Stefanski: back now
[2025-02-27T13:52:13.041679] Hubert Stefanski: IaC doing what it does best :)
[2025-02-27T13:55:47.299449] Juanje Ojeda: I wonder why that job was still looking for a runner. I cancel it because it was 16 min in and nothing :thinking_face:
I restarted it again, to see if now it pick a runner.
[2025-02-27T13:57:33.179599] Kanitha Chim: I have MR that has been pending for awhile as well
[2025-02-27T14:03:45.509089] Hubert Stefanski: a future improvement we can use openshift image streams to build on the cluster and have it available in the local registry
[2025-02-27T14:03:51.227399] Hubert Stefanski: on top of the quay build we do
[2025-02-28T11:57:57.479139] Luigi Pellecchia: May I ask a review at <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/infrastructure/-/merge_requests/444>
[2025-02-28T12:53:28.037739] Hubert Stefanski: merged ^^
[2025-02-28T13:08:56.033079] Luigi Pellecchia: thanks

Title: python313-pdm: Introduce image (!85) · Merge requests · Red Hat / Edge / ci-cd / Pipe X / Tools / Auto Toolchain Containers · GitLab
Hi <@U0171SJF00H>
I've created a patch for introducing a python313-pdm image in <https://gitlab.com/redhat/edge/ci-cd/pipe-x/tools/auto-toolchain-containers/-/merge_requests/85>
IIUC, I need an image registry to upload the image to.
Can you please create one for it?
[2025-03-04T13:07:19.919719] Hubert Stefanski: Yeah, I'll create the repo for it now
[2025-03-04T13:07:52.950669] Hubert Stefanski: <@U04JRTQ4LHK> you want this public right? ^^
[2025-03-04T13:37:31.510119] Ryan Smith: Yes, as the other ones are
[2025-03-04T13:39:24.066669] Michael Ho: <@U0171SJF00H> Why don't you manage the toolchain container images in IaC like Ryan set up for FoA? <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/infrastructure/-/tree/main/quay/auto-fusa?ref_type=heads>
[2025-03-04T13:40:17.917169] Hubert Stefanski: We'd like to, but given the lack of interns in toolchain I haven't found the time myself :wink:
[2025-03-04T13:40:53.140159] Hubert Stefanski: but it is absolutely something I'd like to have
[2025-03-05T11:53:00.998939] Juanje Ojeda: I didn't know <@U04AXB4GK52> has done that. It looks really good. Did you share it before? I don't remember seeing anything about it.
We definitively should use it for toolchain's containers :slightly_smiling_face:
[2025-03-06T12:23:16.615339] Juanje Ojeda: <@U02DXVBD5CP> I was checking the TC and confirming with Roni that we're not using the mirror anymore. We had the mirror to avoid the test failing due to long downloads for the images, but it seems like that's no longer an issue.
Should we remove the the mirror? Less traffic and one infra piece less to maintain.
WDYT?
[2025-03-06T12:24:24.808099] Kanitha Chim: I think the performance and scale team might use it
[2025-03-06T12:25:49.438119] Kanitha Chim: there's not much thing to maintain there, I would keep it until we have better solution for rhivos webserver
[2025-03-06T12:26:27.299149] Kanitha Chim: since right now, we have plan on regularly maintaining webserver host and updating container
[2025-03-06T12:31:01.714129] Juanje Ojeda: Well, we do a lot of transfer there and we need to update it every time we do a release. Not a lot of maintenance, but some. And costs.
[2025-03-06T12:32:04.972069] Juanje Ojeda: We can ask P&amp;S. I'm not sure which URL are they using :thinking_face:
[2025-03-06T12:40:58.327489] Kanitha Chim: yes, let's make sure nobody will use it
[2025-03-06T12:42:19.613759] Kanitha Chim: always better to not maintaining many services but onece we give back the resources(volume) it's a bit time consuming to ask back again
[2025-03-06T16:18:14.915299] Juanje Ojeda: <@U04MGT65NQJ> <@U02DXVBD5CP> the rhivos webserver is down :disappointed:
I'm chekcing but I still don't see anything. The container is running, but I don't see anything from the container logs
[2025-03-06T16:19:35.021999] Kanitha Chim: has there any changes?
[2025-03-06T16:19:52.415759] Juanje Ojeda: None that I can see
[2025-03-06T16:20:41.921539] Kanitha Chim: Status: up 2 days
[2025-03-06T16:20:47.254009] Kanitha Chim: maybe there is recent change
[2025-03-06T16:21:12.336449] Kanitha Chim: maybe try restarting for now?
[2025-03-06T16:21:45.323749] Kanitha Chim: oh it's back
[2025-03-06T16:21:45.583329] Juanje Ojeda: Maybe it's me, I see the keepalive doing fine. Could you check the web?
[2025-03-06T16:21:48.726089] Kanitha Chim: lol
[2025-03-06T16:21:52.202869] Juanje Ojeda: Maybe it's my vpn
[2025-03-06T16:21:58.777509] Juanje Ojeda: Oh
[2025-03-06T16:22:03.007999] Kanitha Chim: no it was down for me too
[2025-03-06T16:22:06.149469] Kanitha Chim: but now it's back
[2025-03-06T16:22:10.848679] Juanje Ojeda: magic
[2025-03-06T16:22:18.559009] Juanje Ojeda: weird
[2025-03-06T16:22:42.936919] Juanje Ojeda: do we have a splurk logs we can check?
[2025-03-06T16:23:27.463919] Kanitha Chim: maybe but I don't know where to find
[2025-03-06T16:23:39.043489] Kanitha Chim: <@U04MGT65NQJ> ^^
[2025-03-06T16:26:43.748219] Eitan Raviv: look for a dashboard with the name `rhivos-webserver-10.33.77.220` on <https://rhcorporate.splunkcloud.com/en-US/app/launcher/home>
[2025-03-06T16:28:22.951279] Kanitha Chim: thanks <@U04MGT65NQJ>
[2025-03-06T16:32:48.970249] Eitan Raviv: but I think it would be easier to search journalctl on the machine, the splunk logs are horrible to navigate unless you are familiar with its DSL

[2025-03-07T15:16:16.294199] Michal Skrivanek: let's see next friday:) thanks!
[2025-03-11T16:22:13.517129] Juanje Ojeda: <@U04MGT65NQJ> <@U0171SJF00H> did we changed anything in the runners for the d-p-a-c project?
The pipeline got stuck in this job: <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/downstream-pipelines-as-code/-/jobs/32239775>
[2025-03-14T12:45:41.864159] Hubert Stefanski: pretty easy review for anyone around <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/infrastructure/-/merge_requests/455>
[2025-03-14T12:45:47.431609] Hubert Stefanski: <@U04NLT3HY3Y> ^^ this onboards bos2
[2025-03-17T10:56:02.148879] Hubert Stefanski: Hey <@U04MGT65NQJ>, <@U04MUFF92JZ> was wondering if you could help out getting a runner up for <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/functional-safety/kernel-test-sufficiency>
[2025-03-17T16:30:18.993569] Juanje Ojeda: <@U04MGT65NQJ> Any idea why this jobs is not picking up the runner? :thinking_face:
<https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/downstream-pipelines-as-code/-/jobs/32417456>
The `release` runner seems to be online :thinking_face:
[2025-03-19T15:53:55.037029] Juanje Ojeda: I just wanted to say that I'm very happy that we have new runners and that they seem to work fine and faster :slightly_smiling_face:
The last pipeline took `155 minutes`  ~ 2.5 hours :thinking_face: :slightly_smiling_face:
[2025-03-19T15:54:45.411619] Juanje Ojeda: Thanks, <@U04MGT65NQJ> for all the work and <@U0171SJF00H> for all the help there :clap:
[2025-03-20T10:23:25.467649] Avihai Efrat: Great news ! Thank you both <@U04MGT65NQJ> and <@U0171SJF00H> :clap: :clap: :clap:

<https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/infrastructure/-/merge_requests/435/diffs>
simple MR to configure renovate for our repositories
[2025-03-28T12:52:51.956459] Hubert Stefanski: You'll also see it sending out merge requests for renovate.json, to enable dependency updates for the relevant groups
[2025-03-28T12:53:19.375279] Hubert Stefanski: <@U04AXB4GK52> if you'd like to have contcert included here as well, feel free to extend: `RENOVATE_EXTRA_FLAGS: --autodiscover=true --autodiscover-namespaces=automotive/pipe-x,automotive/fences,automotive/services`
[2025-03-31T08:01:18.897989] Hubert Stefanski: ^^ one approval remaining, if anyone would be so kind :meow_pwettyplease:
[2025-03-31T11:48:42.692679] Ryan Smith: Any idea why Im not able to run manual deploy jobs on the latest infrastructure pipeline?
[2025-03-31T11:49:00.876059] Ryan Smith: Do I have to submit an empty MR for contcert in order to run those jobs?
[2025-03-31T11:50:59.561329] Ryan Smith: Looks like I can do manual run against the main branch
[2025-03-31T12:02:41.909579] Hubert Stefanski: What I usually do is take the latest pipeline and run the relevant job manually from there
[2025-03-31T12:15:28.131389] Ryan Smith: yeah that's what I mean is I cant do that
[2025-03-31T12:15:35.814529] Ryan Smith: It says Im not authorized to run those jobs
[2025-03-31T12:48:28.281389] Hubert Stefanski: oh, :thinking_face:  alright let me run that one for you, preprod or prod?
[2025-03-31T12:48:44.895419] Hubert Stefanski: I didn't remove you from any of those groups, and I'm pretty certain you had those permissions before
[2025-03-31T12:56:44.177539] Ryan Smith: Id like to run these two in order:
• `deploy-ansible-mpp-contcert-admin-prod`
• `deploy-ansible-mpp-contcert-prod`
[2025-03-31T13:13:13.402609] Hubert Stefanski: done
[2025-03-31T13:22:09.032889] Ryan Smith: :thinking_meow:
[2025-03-31T13:23:11.061469] Ryan Smith: I must not have the limit ranges up to date in the playbook then
[2025-03-31T13:24:20.210879] Ryan Smith: I do, so why didn't it apply correctly
[2025-03-31T13:24:20.769859] Hubert Stefanski: are you exceeding the limit ranges or the appliedResourceQuota for the tenant?
[2025-03-31T13:24:35.437899] Ryan Smith: No those should match preprod already
[2025-03-31T13:24:42.188609] Hubert Stefanski: not sure if you've requested a resource increase already
[2025-03-31T13:24:48.573269] Hubert Stefanski: if not, it's quite easy, if yes, then ignore me
[2025-03-31T13:25:48.163809] Ryan Smith: Yeah I had both clusters get a boost at the same time, they match
[2025-03-31T13:26:13.750979] Ryan Smith: Trying to bring to limit ranges up-to-speed, I suspect something with my use of include means the task didn't actually get run
[2025-03-31T13:26:21.265879] Ryan Smith: Going to try this locally
[2025-03-31T13:52:28.976659] Ryan Smith: okay, figured out what's going on there. Since the tasks in `limits.yml` don't have tags the include task runs, but none of the included tasks are run
[2025-03-31T13:52:32.622979] Ryan Smith: Submitting an MR to fix
[2025-03-31T14:24:28.148009] Juanje Ojeda: <@U0171SJF00H> do you know why are we getting this error in the ansible validator for deploying a new TC release?
<https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/infrastructure/-/jobs/32940049>
I just changed the container image tag, but I see more changes in the ansible output. I don't see any errors, but the job fails :thinking_face:
Sounds familiar?
[2025-03-31T14:25:19.621359] Ryan Smith: Ive seen this before and usually solved it by re-running the job
[2025-03-31T14:25:26.606149] Ryan Smith: It seems to be a transient thing
[2025-03-31T14:25:40.125869] Juanje Ojeda: Never mind, it seems like someone retried it and now passed
[2025-04-01T09:52:48.382549] Hubert Stefanski: Howdy, can anyone take a look at  <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/infrastructure/-/merge_requests/419>? looks like it's been running stable on preprod
[2025-04-01T11:35:00.401519] Hubert Stefanski: <@U04AXB4GK52> <@U04JRTQ4LHK>
I'm taking a look at the renovate config, it seems to be running stuff for:
```automotive/fences/manual-reviews
automotive/fences/contcert
automotive/fences/cc-kpi-scripts
automotive/fences/uas-middleware
automotive/fences/contcert-in-action
automotive/fences/certified-nvras```
Can we archive any of these? I'll submit an MR to do so if you're not using these anymore :meow_thx:
[2025-04-01T11:35:45.250329] Michael Ho: afaik, these can be archived - but can't renovate just be configured to ignore automotive/fences?
[2025-04-01T11:53:49.544579] Hubert Stefanski: we've got other things in automotive/fences that we want it to run for
[2025-04-01T11:55:22.827499] Michael Ho: ack
[2025-04-01T11:55:32.683219] Michael Ho: then yeah, should be fine to archive
[2025-04-01T12:05:51.295699] Hubert Stefanski: <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/infrastructure/-/merge_requests/472> for reviews ;)
[2025-04-01T13:12:14.383339] Hubert Stefanski: <@U02F2L89YTS> <@U04Q4USRZTM> <@U04QNH25QA1> can we get <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/infrastructure/-/merge_requests/445> merged?
[2025-04-01T13:12:47.599379] Hubert Stefanski: I'll create followup tickets to  resolve the SSL issue and the eventual preprod migration to the new UI (that requires a bit more work)
[2025-04-01T16:15:24.333599] Ozan Unsal: jobs in scheduled-jobs seem to be stuck <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/scheduled-jobs/-/pipelines> :disappointed:
[2025-04-01T16:21:06.835229] Juanje Ojeda: The group runners weren't enabled for that project and they probably couldn't find any runner because the `docker` tag. I've just enabled the group runners
[2025-04-01T16:21:56.480909] Juanje Ojeda: I stopped the stuck pipelines and I retried the last one
[2025-04-01T16:22:05.668599] Juanje Ojeda: Now is running
[2025-04-02T11:36:01.353569] Hubert Stefanski: Easy review for someone <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/infrastructure/-/merge_requests/474>
[2025-04-02T11:36:09.323859] Hubert Stefanski: just re-arranging variables for easier readability
[2025-04-02T13:04:38.548749] Juanje Ojeda: <@U04MGT65NQJ> <@U04NNGY4QQ2> <@U0171SJF00H> we should create a ticket to increase the size for the volume used in the autosd webserver. With the new policy retention we definitively will need more space.
Here is were is defined right now: <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/infrastructure/-/blob/main/openshift/managed-platform+/autosd-webserver/vars/common.yml?ref_type=heads#L10|https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/infrastructure/-/blob/main/openshift/ma[…]-platform+/autosd-webserver/vars/common.yml?ref_type=heads>
[2025-04-02T13:07:48.771829] Juanje Ojeda: Question about `Renovate` : does anyone knows if it's possible to group the updates?
I see a lot of individual MRs with a single update instead a single one with all the updates. I kinda remember seeing MRs with multiple updates in the past. Or maybe I imagined :thinking_face:
[2025-04-02T15:02:06.821699] Luigi Pellecchia: I see the most of the pipelines in gitlab are paused. any issue there?
[2025-04-02T16:00:34.767319] Juanje Ojeda: <@U04MGT65NQJ> we have a problem with the runners used by the Test Console. They were having the issue with the `docker`  tag...
I made a change so they use the tag `shared-podman` and they seemed to work, but I'm seeing other issues now. I don't think those runners are very reliable...
Would it be possible to use our pool of runners for TC and TC-frontend? Or to add another pool for them?
That service is critical for us and they need their pipelines working.
[2025-04-02T20:40:52.516429] Nisha Saini: Hi All, there seems to be a misconfigured CMDB ID for autosd webserver here it should be AUTO-001
[2025-04-03T08:10:47.029249] Luigi Pellecchia: Hi everyone,
I still see gitlab pipelines in pause. Any updates on that side?
Thanks
[2025-04-03T09:11:46.763599] Avihai Efrat: Which ones <@U04Q4USRZTM> ? DPAC or test console one?
[2025-04-03T09:12:09.096719] Luigi Pellecchia: Test console

[2025-04-03T09:24:36.797289] Luigi Pellecchia: We need it working if we want to run we CTC as well
[2025-04-03T09:29:55.956909] Robert O'Brien: 2 of the 3 smoke tests failed in DPAC nightly.  The successful job has just completed.
I'll push retry on the DPAC pipeline...
[2025-04-03T09:46:14.405189] Hubert Stefanski: I think Eitan is going to provision some more runners that should cover TC pipelines as well,
[2025-04-03T09:46:20.889779] Hubert Stefanski: did you update the tags to run on shared-podman?
[2025-04-03T09:49:45.787669] Luigi Pellecchia: yes we merged that changes
[2025-04-03T09:50:40.865809] Luigi Pellecchia: some pipeline there restarted but the one I need that is the one related to the patterfly-ui branch
[2025-04-03T09:51:21.009559] Luigi Pellecchia: and this one in the frontend project <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/services/test-console-frontend/-/merge_requests/8>
[2025-04-03T09:53:22.989469] Luigi Pellecchia: I'm trying to cancel them and to restart again let see
[2025-04-03T09:54:01.189029] Luigi Pellecchia: oh I think I have to change the tag in the branch as well right?
[2025-04-03T09:58:52.149469] Luigi Pellecchia: that's the problem, now the pipeline are running
[2025-04-03T12:48:52.820879] Luigi Pellecchia: guys what about this error: <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/services/test-console/-/jobs/33081961>
[2025-04-03T13:13:37.860999] Ryan Smith: Retried it, very strange
[2025-04-03T14:24:44.611079] Juanje Ojeda: Oh, I saw that error in another repo yesterday. It's related with the runners config and the image specify in the job.
If the runner doesn't set any pattern for accepting images, it'll use the format:
`*/*:*` which means: `registry_name+namespace/image_name:tag`
In this case, the image is missing the tag. We need to put some tag to the image there.
[2025-04-03T14:26:12.856869] Juanje Ojeda: That change I see in the MR should fix it:
```-  image: <http://quay.io/automotive-toolchain/prettier|quay.io/automotive-toolchain/prettier>
+  image: <http://quay.io/automotive-toolchain/prettier:latest|quay.io/automotive-toolchain/prettier:latest>```
[2025-04-03T14:27:13.120759] Juanje Ojeda: But maybe the problem is because there is some conflict with the main branch. <@U04Q4USRZTM> you should rebase fixing those conflicts and you should be fine.
[2025-04-03T15:42:53.071409] Hubert Stefanski: I peed myself a little with excitement
[2025-04-03T15:42:54.150679] Hubert Stefanski: File Browser - AutoSD Downloads

[2025-04-03T15:43:12.848079] Hubert Stefanski: autosd downloads edge-replicated through cloudfront
[2025-04-03T15:43:37.137539] Hubert Stefanski: still a few small issues, but I've been fighting getting the index and configuration all day today
[2025-04-03T15:45:00.264019] Hubert Stefanski: now to get the file download working :)
[2025-04-03T18:19:38.377489] Juanje Ojeda: I was testing it and everything was great until I realized what you just said in this last comment :sweat_smile:
[2025-04-03T18:24:23.978969] Hubert Stefanski: I think it's close, this access denied stuff I think is just the bucket ACL
[2025-04-04T07:53:45.201469] Michael Ho: <@U0171SJF00H> Is that a javascript rendered web ui? Probably will break recursive wget users..
[2025-04-04T07:59:17.990379] Hubert Stefanski: It is, and it will, but since the path is actually a url param, you can drop the param and use the full path to hit cloudfront directly circumventing the UI
I still need to test that theory though
i.e for Web UI views:  <https://d1ewg8xlqy08zb.cloudfront.net/?p=autosd9-202504030201/integration-testing/fusa-minimal/> -&gt; for wget: <https://d1ewg8xlqy08zb.cloudfront.net/autosd9-202504030201/integration-testing/fusa-minimal/>
[2025-04-04T08:00:14.530009] Hubert Stefanski: by navigating through the web UI you never really leave the top level index.html
[2025-04-04T08:00:49.711789] Hubert Stefanski: anyhow, all theory until proven in practice, so I'm trying to figure out what hidden permissions are causing the access denied
[2025-04-04T08:07:10.238799] Michael Ho: Not sure wget recursive/spider handles that (I think it parses out all anchor tags in a html page to find links)
[2025-04-04T08:07:39.673579] Michael Ho: I mean, up to you guys, just saying that you might break wget recursive users which to me is a useful/expected thing to use when downloading releases etc
[2025-04-04T08:10:12.642909] Hubert Stefanski: hmm, It might still be possible _I think_ if the underlying s3 bucket has static web hosting enabled, that usually worked for recursive wgets? cloudfront has the ability to "front" s3 static websites as opposed to the s3 itself, so still experimenting
[2025-04-04T08:40:59.282319] Luigi Pellecchia: May I ask for a review at <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/services/test-console/-/merge_requests/343>
It is to configure this weekend CTC, thanks
[2025-04-04T08:45:07.813829] Michael Ho: <@U0171SJF00H> Can you give me access to the rhivos-dashboard ec2 instance (ssh key) just so I can take a quick look? There's a high prio item going on that could be resolved easily but the Israeli's are on their weekend and Sameera is some hours away from starting
[2025-04-04T11:50:48.058059] Luigi Pellecchia: To trigger weekend CTC <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/infrastructure/-/merge_requests/479>
[2025-04-07T14:00:48.742989] Juanje Ojeda: <@U02DXVBD5CP> do you know if we need this repo anymore? <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/services/build-manifest-producer>
I see a few MRs from renovate, but I think we're not using that repo anymore, correct?
Maybe we should archive the repos we're not using. It'll avoid some noise from renovate and makes easy to find things.
WDYT?
[2025-04-08T14:11:37.367449] Juanje Ojeda: <@U04MGT65NQJ> <@U02DXVBD5CP> any reason not to use ubi9 instead of fedora for this? <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/services/supply-chain-webserver/-/merge_requests/44/diffs>
[2025-04-08T14:13:33.564819] Kanitha Chim: probably goofys was not available there
[2025-04-08T14:14:20.012539] Kanitha Chim: Learn how to install Mountpoint for Amazon S3 so that you can manage S3 bucket objects on your local file system.
Title: Installing Mountpoint - Amazon Simple Storage Service
I was thinking if we should use this instead in the future <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/mountpoint-installation.html>
[2025-04-08T14:19:22.730599] Juanje Ojeda: Good question :thinking_face:
I saw some benchmarks comparing goofys with s3fs, and goofys was way better, but I guess this one from AWS should work fine :thinking_face:
[2025-04-08T14:19:28.736469] Juanje Ojeda: &gt; probably goofys was not available there
Well, it's not available on fedora either. We download and install it from the tarball :thinking_face:
[2025-04-08T14:38:39.020569] Kanitha Chim: we can update to ubi if it's preferred, maybe let's try to switch to amazon mountpoint since goofys has not many activities recently
[2025-04-08T14:40:51.665109] Juanje Ojeda: I think ubi is preferred by Prod&amp;Sec as it's RH maintained supposed to be production ready.
[2025-04-08T14:43:18.302569] Juanje Ojeda: I did some basic tests with mountpoint and it's easy to setup and seems to be working fine. But I'm not sure about the performance.
```# time find /mnt/RHIVOS-1/latest-RHIVOS-1/repos/ &gt; /dev/null

real	0m24.306s
user	0m0.012s
sys	0m0.063s```
vs goofys:
```# time find /mnt/buckets/in-vehicle-os-9/RHIVOS-1/latest-RHIVOS-1/repos/ &gt; /dev/null

real	0m9.347s
user	0m0.008s
sys	0m0.018s```
I need to configure locally the goofys, so it's a fair comparison, but my laptop should be equally or more powerful than the webserver :thinking_face:
[2025-04-08T14:43:54.183389] Juanje Ojeda: And the results are almost 3 times slower.
[2025-04-08T14:44:13.664729] Kanitha Chim: yeah last time, I tried it was also pretty slow
[2025-04-08T14:51:47.117429] Juanje Ojeda: I repeated the goofys in my machine and it was a bit slower, but still much faster than mountpoint:
```# time find /mnt/RHIVOS-1/latest-RHIVOS-1/repos/ &gt; /dev/null

real	0m11.446s
user	0m0.005s
sys	0m0.019s```
And the second time it took now time at all. I guess it was cached.
I need to try that with mountpoint :thinking_face:
[2025-04-16T12:29:45.320749] Michael Ho: Hi, I need to do an SIA for auto-toolchain-dashboard, does someone know if I can change the owner of that and who that might be in toolchain now?
[2025-04-16T12:30:15.228759] Michael Ho: (afaik, we're still using auto-toolchain-dashboard)
[2025-04-16T12:31:58.562859] Michael Ho: <@U04AGQD0K8D> Do you know?
[2025-04-16T12:36:15.721579] Hubert Stefanski: Do we need SIA for internal tooling? That dashboard has no "functional" purpose for the product itself
[2025-04-16T12:36:18.358359] Nisha Saini: Hi Michael, yes we can change the owner & delegate. It needs to go through the catalog team Or if this is urgent you can just email `<mailto:techresilience@redhat.com|techresilience@redhat.com>` with below details:
1. *Application Name* (as it appears in the ServiceNow CMDB)
2. *Application ID* (as it appears in the ServiceNow CMDB) 
3. *SIA Respondent* (the full name and Red Hat email address of the person that will complete the survey)
[2025-04-16T12:50:31.999529] Kanitha Chim: <@U02JHD5HMGC> could you be the owner of dashboard?
[2025-04-16T13:06:02.573739] Michael Ho: &gt; Hi Michael, yes we can change the owner &amp; delegate. It needs to go through the catalog team Or if this is urgent you can just email
It's not urgent, I can close up the current SIA as it has a deadline but would be good to handover this after that
[2025-04-16T13:08:50.409769] Michael Ho: I see you did it, <@U04AGQD0K8D>! Thank you!
[2025-04-17T14:59:31.191919] Hubert Stefanski: Heads up, i'll be doing some work on the preprod instance of the autosd webserver, don't think anyone will notice, but just wanted to FYI it for clarity

I've seen a couple of nights the pipeline failing then restarting and passing, But when you see the link for the failure notification, it points to the GitLab CEE Staging :thinking_face:
[2025-04-24T10:50:04.192049] Michael Ho: I also got emails about something from a GitLab CEE Staging instance
[2025-04-24T10:50:37.531059] Michael Ho: I think they're running a staging instance to do tests and we're seeing pipeline runs from it. Tbh, pretty scary, what if those pipeline runs did something bad...
[2025-04-24T10:58:51.634389] Juanje Ojeda: yeah... they are producing false negatives and it's a bit confusing. Also, not sure if/when they run our stuff in prod vs staging...
[2025-04-24T11:08:00.185569] Michael Ho: Someone should ask in <#C04HGR58KKL|> to find out what this staging instance is doing

[2025-04-30T09:59:52.811769] Hubert Stefanski: I just stumbled across <https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/terraformer>, wish I found it sooner... I'll share some thoughts once I start using it
[2025-04-30T10:00:14.531529] Hubert Stefanski: &gt; CLI tool that generates `tf`/`json` and `tfstate` files based on existing infrastructure (reverse Terraform).
[2025-04-30T10:00:42.891729] Hubert Stefanski: Would have been useful a dozen times or so already :meow_angery2:
[2025-04-30T12:24:38.501589] Hubert Stefanski: Small update, it's pretty cool... I had some dependency issues setting it up locally, but that seems to be more of an effect of my smoothbrain than it is of the tool itself.
With some minimal config and one command run, it generated the entire terraform file for the autosd cloudfront deployment in not even 5 seconds
[2025-04-30T12:25:51.756709] Hubert Stefanski: This is super impressive, and useful, which now means in theory we can fully deploy stuff manually on the staging AWS account, capture it with terraformer, and then move it over to auto-prod with some minimal config alterations
[2025-04-30T12:26:27.905289] Hubert Stefanski: The supported modules are also quite impressive, i.e <https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/terraformer/blob/master/docs/gitlab.md> would have been useful when I imported our entire gitlab.cee configuration by hand, one-by-one :swear:
[2025-04-30T12:28:16.643259] Michael Ho: You should blog post this to share the knowledge :)
[2025-04-30T12:29:14.508359] Hubert Stefanski: <https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/terraformer/blob/master/docs/kubernetes.md> would also be nice, but this seems to struggle from the fact that the upstream module provider isn't that well fleshed out in the first place, so it's really limited to the base k8s API, without any CRDs (custom resource definitions)
[2025-04-30T12:29:53.655059] Hubert Stefanski: Not that I'd want to use it, I think helm is much better for handling k8s deployments anyways, but the option is there, which is nice enough by itself
[2025-04-30T12:31:08.208269] Hubert Stefanski: &gt;  You should blog post this to share the knowledge :)
I've been meaning to blog about more things, need to set up a blog page first :sweat_smile:  I now refuse to "the source" :sick-8411:  on principle

[2025-05-05T09:48:40.139569] Michael Ho: <@U04MGT65NQJ> Hey, I hear you've set up the GitLab runners for toolchain on a set of ec2 instances that auto-scale, are configured per group, etc. Can you set up a small pool for FoA to try out again? Prefereably with a large ec2 instance to back it so we can develop at speed :)
[2025-05-05T11:22:12.482219] Juanje Ojeda: <@U04JRTQ4LHK> any preference about the region? We have deployed lately the runners on US, so they are closer to the service that generates the composes and other stuff we heavily use. Not sure if you have this sort of constraints.

[2025-05-06T08:52:40.706699] Kanitha Chim: <@U04MGT65NQJ> I'm seeing this pipeline is taking very long again <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/fences/gating/gator/-/merge_requests/143/pipelines>
maybe something is wrong there
[2025-05-06T09:27:08.466209] Hubert Stefanski: Can I get some reviews here?
<https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/infrastructure/-/merge_requests/486>

the pipelines won't pass and that's expected, I'll need to do some manual cleanup on the namespace prior to deploying this new instance
[2025-05-06T14:21:12.263229] Juanje Ojeda: I'm not sure why the <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/downstream-pipelines-as-code/-/jobs/34249244|generate-compose job> takes 90 mins to finish. It was so much faster after we moved to the new runners.
Most of the time is uploading the rpms, which supposed to be faster now :thinking_face:
I see the job running here `pipe-x-ds-gitlab-docker-runner-pool-us-east-2` so it should be in the right region.

[2025-05-06T14:24:38.394659] Michal Skrivanek: <@U0171SJF00H> / <@U04JDAPLMSN> do we still run any OCP cluster ourselves or everything has been moved to MP+ and ITUP ? Any with admin privileges?
[2025-05-06T14:27:44.010219] Hubert Stefanski: yep, only MP/ITUP
[2025-05-06T14:27:59.116609] Hubert Stefanski: What do you need from it?
[2025-05-06T14:35:55.299499] Michal Skrivanek: for devspaces deployment we're still pondering where to run that. ideally hosted by _someone_. But the deployment needs privileged pods and custom CRDs so....IIUC MP+ is out, and admin on the cluster is needed
[2025-05-06T14:38:40.248989] Michal Skrivanek: if that _someone_ is toolchain that is still better than building and managing yet another complete cluster
[2025-05-06T14:46:45.359929] Hubert Stefanski: I complain about this regularly, but the platform tooling (i.e Ready to go Openshift clusters, CDNs, web servers, etc. etc.) is abysmall in RH
[2025-05-06T14:47:14.559709] Hubert Stefanski: I really wish it wasn't the case that we had to look to deploy and manage stuff ourselves from scratch every time
[2025-05-06T14:47:47.923189] Hubert Stefanski: Why can't we just have an IT-provided ansible playbook/terraform config etc. for a specific bit of technology and just use that on our own Cost Centre based AWS accounts
[2025-05-06T14:49:51.976639] Michal Skrivanek: <@U0171SJF00H> so in a separate thread they mentioned "a Single Tenant Cluster (STC), perhaps with a hosted control plan, that gives you more of a hosted experience, but you have cluster admin".
I'll add you to the thread. We wanna find something reasonable so that the devspaces people don't have to manage the cluster, and sure, ideally not even toolchain would have to.
[2025-05-07T08:54:00.523969] Hubert Stefanski: &gt;  &gt;&gt; * Give you a Single Tenant Cluster (STC), perhaps with a hosted control plan, that gives you more of a hosted experience, but you have cluster admin
Ah, in the context of the email you CC'd this makes much more sense
[2025-05-07T08:54:24.576139] Hubert Stefanski: I think that's probably the best solution out of the ones they've listed
[2025-05-07T08:55:16.842609] Hubert Stefanski: That _should_ give free reign over the node to admin level, while also not caring about the entire cluster
[2025-05-07T08:55:33.970319] Hubert Stefanski: (Hosted Control Planes are just :chefs-kiss-blob:)
[2025-05-07T09:40:16.634749] Hubert Stefanski: Any reviewers available for: <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/infrastructure/-/merge_requests/507>?
This adds the nightly cache invalidation policy for AutoSD builds on cloudfront
<@U04MGT65NQJ> I see the plan is attempting to change some QE IAM policies, I'm wondering why that is, I thought we merged them already?
[2025-05-07T09:55:34.280919] Eitan Raviv: <@U0171SJF00H> I played around with the qe policy yesterday manually due to a new request from Rachel and restored the settings back. probably missed sth. I'll fix it, also looking at !507
[2025-05-07T09:58:22.662319] Hubert Stefanski: ah, cool, just wanted to know I wasn't messing something up if I got this merged :sweat_smile: thanks for clarifying
[2025-05-07T11:08:59.333469] Juanje Ojeda: <@U0171SJF00H> excuse my ignorance, but I always get lost with the cache configs. Which would be the effect of this config?
```  default_ttl = 43200 # 12 hours default TTL for nightly builds
  min_ttl     = 3600  # 1 hour minimum TTL
  max_ttl     = 43200 # 12 hour maximum TTL```
[2025-05-07T11:13:55.799889] Hubert Stefanski: Basically:

min_ttl - the minimum amount of time the objects will be retained in the cloudfront cach, so in our case at least 1 hour before cloudfront will reach out to the s3 bucket for a refresh
max_ttl - the maximum of  ^^ so at most our objects will live for 12 hours in the cache, then cloudfront will forward the next "out of TTL" request to the s3 bucket for a refresh
default - the one we really care about, so halving the default cache time from cloudfront itself, which IIRC is 24hrs
[2025-05-07T11:14:19.432109] Hubert Stefanski: The reason for that is users can pass headers in the request to circumvent the cache and force a refresh from the s3 bucket
[2025-05-07T11:14:49.942239] Hubert Stefanski: min is the one that will say "it's too early" and will reject that request with the cache request headers
[2025-05-07T11:15:19.150119] Juanje Ojeda: I see :thinking_face:
[2025-05-07T11:17:06.110399] Juanje Ojeda: What  would happen if the nightly change at 11 am and a user try to access it at that time or a bit earlier? Will it get the old nightly for 12 hours? (unless it forces to avoid the cache or something like that?
[2025-05-07T11:17:45.273129] Hubert Stefanski: hmm, perhaps I should drop it down a bit more
[2025-05-07T11:18:05.347389] Hubert Stefanski: Ideally, the pipeline would send a cache invalidation to the distribution once it completes the nightly
[2025-05-07T11:18:16.533229] Hubert Stefanski: but I saw that as additional functionality for the future, and didn't want to bother the pipeline
[2025-05-07T11:18:33.087249] Juanje Ojeda: Oh, that's interesting
[2025-05-07T11:19:29.754909] Juanje Ojeda: That would solve the issue, but maybe dropping it a bit more for now, it's good enough
[2025-05-07T11:19:32.864849] Hubert Stefanski: so, basically once the pipeline completes we should be able to add a new step:
```aws cloudfront create-invalidation \
  --distribution-id DISTRIBUTION_ID \
  --paths "/AutoSD-9/nightly"```

[2025-05-07T11:20:45.203379] Juanje Ojeda: Looks easy enough :thinking_face:  We could try to add it once the pipelines are working again :ok_hand:
[2025-05-07T11:21:48.170209] Hubert Stefanski: yep, didn't wanna throw that :wrench:  into the :gear:  prior to the RC :sweat_smile:
[2025-05-07T11:22:16.686759] Juanje Ojeda: Good call! :wink:
[2025-05-07T17:16:11.407299] Hubert Stefanski: <@U02F2L89YTS> <@U04NNGY4QQ2> if you're still around:
<https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/infrastructure/-/merge_requests/509>
mind taking a look at ^^?
[2025-05-07T17:16:49.149019] Hubert Stefanski: ahhh, nvm
[2025-05-07T17:16:54.391779] Hubert Stefanski: give me 2 more minutes :sweat_smile:
[2025-05-07T17:17:01.606239] Hubert Stefanski: I was about to say something worked but it doesn't
[2025-05-07T17:21:53.136439] Juanje Ojeda: These changes looks good. I see how it can improve what we had.
Did you finish what you were changing or we do wait for approving?
[2025-05-07T17:22:13.106629] Hubert Stefanski: please wait
[2025-05-07T17:50:48.433259] Hubert Stefanski: Can you take a look now please?
[2025-05-07T17:51:32.992709] Hubert Stefanski: I didn't change much from the last time you looked, just some volumemount paths
[2025-05-07T17:52:00.199309] Juanje Ojeda: I was about to ask you that. It looks very similar. What I should focus on?
[2025-05-07T17:53:02.223349] Hubert Stefanski: It's the same since last time,  I just reverted a mountpath change that broke something
[2025-05-07T17:53:33.654059] Hubert Stefanski: <https://autosd.stg.sig.centos.org/AutoSD-9/autosd9-202505020201/test_images_info.json>
Should redirect to:
<https://download.autosd.sig.centos.org/AutoSD-9/autosd9-202505020201/info.txt>
[2025-05-07T17:53:56.392149] Hubert Stefanski: I copied two different paths.. but you get the point
[2025-05-07T17:54:29.571139] Hubert Stefanski: <https://autosd.stg.sig.centos.org/AutoSD-9/autosd9-202505020201/test_images_info.json>  -&gt; <https://download.autosd.sig.centos.org/AutoSD-9/autosd9-202505020201/test_images_info.json>
[2025-05-07T17:54:52.043079] Hubert Stefanski: Then the Terraform plan updates should put the builds under /AutoSD-9
[2025-05-07T17:54:57.245399] Hubert Stefanski: they currently throw it into the root dir
[2025-05-07T17:55:06.383399] Hubert Stefanski: but they'll be applied after merging
[2025-05-07T17:55:07.067869] Juanje Ojeda: Hmmm...
```&lt;Error&gt;
&lt;Code&gt;NoSuchKey&lt;/Code&gt;
&lt;Message&gt;The specified key does not exist.&lt;/Message&gt;
&lt;Key&gt;AutoSD-9/autosd9-202505020201/test_images_info.json&lt;/Key&gt;

&lt;/Error&gt;```
[2025-05-07T17:55:19.641669] Hubert Stefanski: that's because cloudfront still has them in the root dir
[2025-05-07T17:55:38.177669] Hubert Stefanski: the .tf files in this MR will make that work
[2025-05-07T17:56:02.564979] Juanje Ojeda: Let me check the MR
[2025-05-07T17:56:03.195889] Hubert Stefanski: specifically this line:

```
    origin_id           = "auto-product-build-origin"
    origin_path         = "/AutoSD-9" # Add origin path to make all content serve from /AutoSD-9```

[2025-05-07T17:56:13.242369] Hubert Stefanski: says "from this origin, put everyting under /AutoSD-9"
[2025-05-07T17:57:19.816779] Juanje Ojeda: Approved
[2025-05-07T17:57:36.379719] Hubert Stefanski: Thank you, I'll merge it and do some more tests
[2025-05-07T18:00:06.480499] Hubert Stefanski: aaand terraform plans failed :cry-laugh:
[2025-05-07T18:05:03.015939] Hubert Stefanski: <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/infrastructure/-/merge_requests/510>
[2025-05-07T18:05:05.600299] Hubert Stefanski: typo
[2025-05-07T18:18:43.608639] Hubert Stefanski: ... one more issue :cry:
[2025-05-07T18:30:11.070069] Juanje Ojeda: Life... :shrug:
[2025-05-07T19:05:42.798529] Hubert Stefanski: <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/infrastructure/-/merge_requests/511>
[2025-05-07T19:05:46.664349] Hubert Stefanski: if you're still around
[2025-05-07T19:06:08.793619] Hubert Stefanski: To summarise:
1. we add the key so it exists so the user can make a request
2. we strip the key so it doesn't exist so that CDN/s3 can actually find it

[2025-05-07T19:06:59.842389] Bot-B07AHF28: mind blown
[2025-05-07T19:07:44.048039] Juanje Ojeda: What is in the lambda.zip file? :thinking_face:
[2025-05-07T19:08:15.067489] Hubert Stefanski: &gt; So... why the lambda@edge function? Basically....
&gt; 1. We need to have the /AutoSD-9 prefix in the key for backward compatibility
&gt; 2. That key doesn't exist on s3 or CDN
&gt; 3. Since that Key doesn't exist, we need to insert it everywhere so that it retains the same format, but.... since that key DOESN"T exist, we need to strip it out before we actually hit the CDN and s3 so that the request can actually find that key....
&gt; 
[2025-05-07T19:08:27.655279] Hubert Stefanski: it's just the lambda function script zipped
[2025-05-07T19:09:10.466329] Hubert Stefanski: actually I need to fix the reference for it :sweat_smile:
[2025-05-07T19:09:46.019529] Hubert Stefanski: I look forward to 10 years down the line someone tracking me down in the bahamas where I'll live my nomad lifestyle
[2025-05-07T19:09:57.140469] Hubert Stefanski: to ask what this ancient lambda function does and why it's there
[2025-05-07T19:10:07.853399] Hubert Stefanski: because people hardcoded that URL for autosd
[2025-05-07T19:10:59.988939] Hubert Stefanski: and i'll stare silently into their eyes
[2025-05-07T19:11:01.286829] Hubert Stefanski: nod
[2025-05-07T19:11:07.507809] Hubert Stefanski: and walk off into the sunset without saying a word
[2025-05-07T19:22:32.874849] Juanje Ojeda: So, it's ready or are you going to change the reference?
[2025-05-07T19:22:52.658379] Hubert Stefanski: should be ready now
[2025-05-07T19:25:49.282589] Juanje Ojeda: Approved. LGTM
[2025-05-07T19:25:56.010029] Hubert Stefanski: thank you
[2025-05-07T19:25:59.451359] Hubert Stefanski: back to testing now
[2025-05-07T19:26:03.417059] Juanje Ojeda: Good idea to use the lambda@edge
[2025-05-07T19:26:41.727079] Hubert Stefanski: that single /AutoSD-9 is currently the bane of my existence
[2025-05-07T19:27:43.571529] Hubert Stefanski: literally, soo much effort to add it for requests and then drop it again so it actually resolves :see_no_evil:
[2025-05-07T19:27:48.872639] Hubert Stefanski: why do people hard code things
[2025-05-07T19:27:54.248319] Hubert Stefanski: why :crycat:
[2025-05-07T19:29:45.217069] Juanje Ojeda: well... the problem is not the hardcoding... the autosd repositories were defined for very long time with that URL, and it's used in the documentation, configs, etc, because it's not expected to change, like the CentOS and RHEL repos.
[2025-05-07T19:31:49.434259] Hubert Stefanski: okay, well I messed something up :cry:
[2025-05-07T19:32:08.129819] Hubert Stefanski: I didn't catch the renaming of the cloudfront distribution :facepalm:
[2025-05-07T19:32:19.241619] Hubert Stefanski: I'll need to update the DNS tomorrow morning
[2025-05-07T19:33:34.000099] Juanje Ojeda: Is it possible to revert the process and testing again in staging (now that we know the main issues we can find), or it harder than moving forward at this point?
[2025-05-07T19:34:07.128759] Hubert Stefanski: oh ,wait I think it might have retained the domain name
[2025-05-07T19:34:51.749849] Hubert Stefanski: nope, nevermind it bork
[2025-05-07T19:36:16.109129] Hubert Stefanski: yeah I'll deploy the old version
[2025-05-07T20:10:10.393719] Hubert Stefanski: <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/infrastructure/-/merge_requests/513>
[2025-05-07T20:10:17.830049] Hubert Stefanski: this should revert it
[2025-05-07T20:21:32.294129] Juanje Ojeda: <https://autosd.sig.centos.org/AutoSD-9/autosd9-202504011405/info.txt> :partying_face:
[2025-05-07T20:22:06.285969] Juanje Ojeda: Still syncing the nightlies, but it does work :slightly_smiling_face:
[2025-05-08T10:40:34.101059] Hubert Stefanski: Fresh new day, new attempts:

<https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/infrastructure/-/merge_requests/514>

reviews here please ^^ Setting up cloudfront to point to my test bucket
[2025-05-09T15:00:22.517889] Hubert Stefanski: Hey folks, Happy Friday, hope y'all learnt something

Just an update on the AutoSD webserver situation
<https://autosd.stg.sig.centos.org>
I've set up the staging instance that I hope has resolved all of the issues we've seen when I pushed the change to production. If people could take a look at this one, and run any scripts/automation they have against it, I'd be super thankful.
Or if you can point me to something that broke last time around so that I can run a test myself, please do.
[2025-05-11T13:31:49.400989] Avihai Efrat: <@U0171SJF00H> please consider posting this at the  <#C0801T4TEQP|> channel to get AIB folks testing on the new stage instance and have awarness of your new AIB fixes.
The one that knows more about aib in this wg is <@U02F2L89YTS> .
[2025-05-12T12:39:47.907389] Hubert Stefanski: Thank you <@U02F2L89YTS> for testing out the stage deployment of the new CDN :thanks-ty:

Based on this, I'd like to plan out the deployment for something non-stage, Currently I'm on the fence between two options:

1. *Request a new DNS entry for <http://summit.autosd.sig.centos.org|summit.autosd.sig.centos.org> - that will host the new deployment specifically for the summit demo*
    a.  *Con:* It doesn't work out of the box with AIB and would require the URL to be updated in the configs
    b. *Pro:* Worst case scenario, bringing down <http://autosd.sig.centos.org|autosd.sig.centos.org> won't happen since this willbe a separate deployment
2. *Deploy  the changes to  prod*
    a. *Con:* Fairly evident based on my previous attemp, but seeing as Juanje tested our "currently known" cases, it might not yield any complaints, this also needs the `auto-product-build` bucket to be updated to nest all existing builds under `AutoSD-9` (not a big deal since we'll still retain the root-directory location, if anyone else is still using that )
    b. *Pro:* No config changes anywhere for the summit demo,
[2025-05-12T12:40:18.289469] Hubert Stefanski: Option 2: will happen inevitably anyway, but the question is whether before or after summit
[2025-05-12T12:52:28.511119] Daniel Farrell: <@U0171SJF00H> no need to request a new DNS entry, we can not do any changes on our side anymore as the lab infra code is frozen now
[2025-05-12T12:54:45.932689] Hubert Stefanski: So option 2 is the only option? :sweat_smile:
[2025-05-12T12:55:39.378799] Daniel Farrell: not if it eventually breaks some things - i guess our best hope now is to pray to the demo gods :wink:
[2025-05-12T12:56:30.616879] Daniel Farrell: i suggest that we do option 2 but the right way with proper testing etc. even if that means we can not do it before summit
[2025-05-12T13:01:39.224719] Hubert Stefanski: Hey folks, Happy Friday, hope y'all learnt something

Just an update on the AutoSD webserver situation

From: Hubert Stefanski
Sender: Thread in Slack Conversation
Based on Juanje's testing here: <https://redhat-internal.slack.com/archives/C05BYR06B0V/p1746802822517889> We think we're covered for the use cases
[2025-05-12T13:06:58.841179] Avihai Efrat: Also, I believe Summit Demo will use AIB for building the images(correct me if I'm wrong here <@U01CA50VC3C>), and as AIB is pretty impossible to change from <http://autosd.sig.centos.org|autosd.sig.centos.org> to something else, option 2 seems like our only option here.

About proper testing - I'll leave it to <@U02F2L89YTS> to decide, one note I have is:
If all the testing are done on our ATC side(as mentioned by Juanje) I think it's also good to get more feedback fast and a heads-up to the <#C0801T4TEQP|> we plan to roll out our deployment after they test or confirm Juanje's testing are enough.
WDYT <@U02F2L89YTS> ?

As you <@U0171SJF00H> are on PTO May15-May19 we do not have much time to test or rollback.
BTW, in the case we'll need to roll back, can you have <@U04MGT65NQJ> in the loop if needed on how to do that when you are in PTO?
[2025-05-12T13:10:34.991619] Hubert Stefanski: I can get those changes out today, looking at our staging deployment it seems to be fairly stable, might have a bit of downtime in-between, worst case scenario we roll back like we did last week and keep it as-is for summit
[2025-05-12T13:10:37.417349] Juanje Ojeda: &gt; I believe Summit Demo will use AIB for building the images(correct me if I'm wrong here <@U01CA50VC3C>), and as AIB is pretty impossible to change from <http://autosd.sig.centos.org|autosd.sig.centos.org> to something else, option 2 seems like our only option here.
Agreed.
[2025-05-12T13:11:30.523299] Hubert Stefanski: Though, our webserver doesn't really do much apart from redirecting to cloudfront, In any case, I would refrain from redeployments from the infra repo during that time :sweat_smile:
[2025-05-12T13:12:43.869429] Juanje Ojeda: When we need this change to be done?
Because we need to build and deliver the RC2 between today and tomorrow. I'd be nice if we could do the change after the RC2 is out.
it shouldn't affect the release, but it would be easier to focus on just one important change a the time, and to avoid blocking possible changes in the pipeline, if needed.
[2025-05-12T13:14:53.954179] Avihai Efrat: As Hubert is on PTO on May15-19 we need this done latest May14 and for someone to be ready to rollback it it fails in production.
[2025-05-12T13:19:25.988289] Avihai Efrat: We can use the time till May14 for you Juanje to work only on the 1.0RC2 build planned for May13 and in that time give a heads up to <#C0801T4TEQP|> folks already ASAP and let them also test against our staging ENV to get more tests by then and if they find anything on stage they can raise it or at least be aware of this incoming change.

[2025-05-12T13:35:00.344719] Michal Skrivanek: I see the links in directory listing of e.g. <https://autosd.stg.sig.centos.org/AutoSD-9/nightly/> points to <http://download.autosd.sig.centos.org|download.autosd.sig.centos.org> but a direct request to e.g.  <https://autosd.sig.centos.org/AutoSD-9/nightly/info.txt> works fine. is it going to be pointing to `download.`?
[2025-05-12T13:37:31.058149] Hubert Stefanski: I'm sorry I'm having a hard time understanding the question
[2025-05-12T13:38:37.837549] Hubert Stefanski: <https://autosd.stg.sig.centos.org/AutoSD-9/nightly/info.txt> should also redirect to download, if that's what you're asking
[2025-05-12T13:41:59.993399] Michal Skrivanek: it doesn't do 301 redirect...so i hope that's going to be fine.
[2025-05-12T13:43:18.625239] Avihai Efrat: <https://autosd.stg.sig.centos.org/AutoSD-9/autosd9-202505020201/test_images_info.json>
Should redirect to:

From: Hubert Stefanski
Sender: Slack Conversation
Maybe related to last implementation that broke from May7 that mentioned redirect to `<http://download.autosd.sig.centos.org|download.autosd.sig.centos.org>` :
<https://redhat-internal.slack.com/archives/C05BYR06B0V/p1746640413654059>

`It's the same since last time,  I just reverted a mountpath change that broke something`
`[8:53 PM] hstefans`

`<https://autosd.stg.sig.centos.org/AutoSD-9/autosd9-202505020201/test_images_info.json>`
`Should redirect to:`
`<https://download.autosd.sig.centos.org/AutoSD-9/autosd9-202505020201/info.txt>`
`[8:53 PM] hstefans`

`I copied two different paths.. but you get the point`

`Then the Terraform plan updates should put the builds under /AutoSD-9`
[2025-05-12T13:44:33.374689] Michal Skrivanek: i think in some of the tURLs in tests are parsed from the listing...i wouldn't be sure it handles redirects fine, but this way it should work...the paths are the same
[2025-05-12T13:47:29.436419] Hubert Stefanski: &gt;  it doesn't do 301 redirect...so i hope that's going to be fine.
Ahh, as in it goes a 404 then redirects?
[2025-05-12T13:48:48.052599] Juanje Ojeda: So, I get this:
```$ curl <https://autosd.stg.sig.centos.org/AutoSD-9/nightly/info.txt>
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN">
&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;302 Found&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Found&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The document has moved &lt;a href="<https://download.autosd.sig.centos.org/AutoSD-9/nightly/info.txt>"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;```
because of the redirection. Maybe it should be a 301 and not 302 redirection? :thinking_face:
But it works fine with this `-L`:
```$ curl -L <https://autosd.stg.sig.centos.org/AutoSD-9/nightly/info.txt>

And from our Python code (or dnf, osbuild, etc). So, unless someones uses a `curl` with no "follow redirections", it should be fine.
[2025-05-12T13:50:17.319959] Hubert Stefanski: I think that's just a one liner:

[2025-05-12T13:50:44.020149] Hubert Stefanski: so shouldn't be a big deal
[2025-05-12T13:50:46.201479] Juanje Ojeda: Yep, that I think will avoid issues
[2025-05-12T13:51:05.809489] Hubert Stefanski: alright, 2 secs and ill push the change to stage
[2025-05-12T13:57:25.831009] Avihai Efrat: `i think in some of the tURLs in tests are parsed from the listing...i wouldn't be sure it handles redirects fine, but this way it should work...the paths are the same`
Are the mentioned tests the new AIB CTC tests added also to test console that failed last time after deployment <@U011CBYSALV>?
If so is there any way we can run those on our staging ENV from test console before deploying to prod to make sure they also work and won't fail in CTC.
[2025-05-12T14:07:20.596569] Michal Skrivanek: yeah i think it's likely there is a curl without -L somewhere
[2025-05-12T14:07:35.849349] Juanje Ojeda: Oh, I forgot about that package test for the aib :facepalm:
It works fine
[2025-05-12T14:07:36.742539] Avihai Efrat: <@U0171SJF00H> in the meantime, can you please inform <#C0801T4TEQP|> about the changes we did and ask for feedbacks or tests they want to run on our staging ENV?
[2025-05-12T14:07:45.830409] Juanje Ojeda: ```$ ./automotive-image-builder compose --distro autosd --dump-variables --fusa empty.aib.yml empty.json | jq -c '.denylist_rpms // []'
["dosfstools","e2fsprogs","erofs-utils","libbpf","xfsprogs"]```
[2025-05-12T14:07:58.812479] Juanje Ojeda: Using the staging URL.
[2025-05-12T14:08:34.172999] Juanje Ojeda: Basically, it ueses aib, which works fine with that URL, so it works.
[2025-05-12T14:08:47.598189] Michal Skrivanek: you'll see once you roll it out:) that's why it's so much fun!
[2025-05-12T14:10:57.023099] Juanje Ojeda: In any case, we had a discussion last week about changing that test to use rhivos instead of autosd. I still think we should change it.
[2025-05-12T14:17:20.478599] Michal Skrivanek: for the above denylist?
[2025-05-12T14:29:47.556019] Hubert Stefanski: that 301 change should be deployed now, got sidetracked and forgot to msg here
[2025-05-12T15:25:02.105169] Juanje Ojeda: <@U020YLADEKA> <@U0171SJF00H> it looks like we're not going to build the RC2 today, and probably not tomorrow either. I'd say that we should move forward with the CDN migration, so we can have more time for fixing stuff before Hubert goes to PTO.
WDYT?
[2025-05-12T15:44:17.011889] Hubert Stefanski: Sure thing, I can get working on that tomorrow morning if it suits? I'd just send out a warning email to auto-devel and auto-sig
[2025-05-12T15:46:16.691769] Hubert Stefanski: It shouldn't take long, but there are a few things that we need to do, the main one being to merge your <@U02F2L89YTS> MR that moves the product builds into X_STREAM directories
[2025-05-12T15:56:58.386669] Juanje Ojeda: BTW, I did anther check. Not sure if it's useful or if anyone is using this, but I tried to download recursively the whole compose.
From the current webserver, this command works:
```wget2 -m -e robots=off --max-threads 8 -np -nH --cut-dirs=3 -R index.html* <https://autosd.sig.centos.org/AutoSD-9/nightly/repos/AutoSD/>```
But the same command using the staging (`<https://autosd.stg.sig.centos.org/AutoSD-9/nightly/repos/AutoSD/>`), only download the structure, but not the actual files.
[2025-05-12T18:19:13.002849] Hubert Stefanski: I still need to figure that out, It's not ideal that that doesn't work, but I haven't found a way to make it work thus far...
The main issue blocking that is the fact that these files don't actually exist on the webserver, and the ones you see through the web UI are generated in a single index.html based on the bucket contents
[2025-05-12T18:19:30.463429] Hubert Stefanski: Upgrade announcement sent btw!
I'll set up the merge requests for a merge train tomorrow morning
[2025-05-12T18:30:45.090329] Hubert Stefanski: <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/infrastructure/-/merge_requests/515> &lt;- Need some reviews here
[2025-05-12T18:32:13.344839] Hubert Stefanski: The pipelines will keep on failing until the migration begins. The current failure is because the playbook is trying to provision 525 gigs in total of volumes, and we're at a 500gb limit, but I'll manually clean up the namespace to drop that previous volume before deploying
[2025-05-12T20:04:04.411059] Avihai Efrat: Maybe <@U01CA50VC3C> can add some insights about what the Demo Summit session is actually going to use for image downloads and building (is it using automotive image builder and if so how ?) so we can know we’re testing the main usage at least for Summit sake.

<@U02F2L89YTS> thanks for the extra testing and going the extra mile!
Just so we’ll know the impact of your latest test, Do we have something (tool, pipeline,script) that tries to do what you tested that might be broken?
[2025-05-12T22:18:58.305059] Juanje Ojeda: Ohhhh... <@U0171SJF00H> thanks for this -&gt; <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/infrastructure/-/blob/5e8a0f9c89474b93d0c705d5cc1061ed90082522/openshift/managed-platform+/autosd-webserver/README.md|https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/infrastructure/-/blob/5e8a0f9c89474b93d[…]522/openshift/managed-platform+/autosd-webserver/README.md>

[2025-05-13T10:47:25.712819] Ozan Unsal: There are 3 MRs in rhivos.git and I guess, these MRs allocates disk space and cause failures in generate-compose job.

```curl <https://autosd.sig.centos.org/nightly/repos/AutoSD/compose/AutoSD/aarch64/os>
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN">
&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;301 Moved Permanently&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Moved Permanently&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The document has moved &lt;a href="<http://autosd.sig.centos.org:8080/nightly/repos/AutoSD/compose/AutoSD/aarch64/os/>"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;```
who can fix that?

About this <https://redhat-internal.slack.com/archives/C04JDFLHJN6/p1747301801310779|thread>...
<@U0171SJF00H> is on PTO till May20 so this is not ideal to change anything right now unless it's urgent or breaking urgent stuff I know.

IIUC the root cause is due to CloudFront cache issues.
This was mitigated manually for now due to Kanitha invalidating the cache for the repodata.

Just so we do not need to do it in summit time(May20) or daily going forward, the CentOS infra folks(<@U013NFL4MN0>  <https://redhat-internal.slack.com/archives/D04RWM2D1M2/p1747310211956939|message>) mentioned they use a 5 min TTL caching policy for metadata files (as we have in the /repodata compose folder).

Is there a way we can add this new custom cache policy to avoid manually needing to invalidate the cache daily?

<@U02F2L89YTS> <@U02DXVBD5CP> <@U04MGT65NQJ> WDYT?

Maybe use something like below at our <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/infrastructure/-/blob/main/aws/terraform/toolchain/upstream/autosd_cloudfront.tf?ref_type=heads|IaC cloudfront config file>:

```# Define a CloudFront cache policy with 5-minute TTL for repodata
resource "aws_cloudfront_cache_policy" "repodata" {
  name        = "RepodataCachePolicy"
  comment     = "Cache repodata files with short TTL"
  default_ttl = 300
  max_ttl     = 300
  min_ttl     = 0

  parameters_in_cache_key_and_forwarded_to_origin {
    cookies_config {
      cookie_behavior = "none"
    }
    headers_config {
      header_behavior = "none"
    }
    query_strings_config {
      query_string_behavior = "none"
    }
  }
}

# Example CloudFront distribution (partial) using the policy
resource "aws_cloudfront_distribution" "example" {
  # ... (origins, logging, etc.) ...

  # Cache behavior for repodata files
  ordered_cache_behavior {
    path_pattern           = "repodata/*"
    target_origin_id       = "MyOrigin"
    viewer_protocol_policy = "redirect-to-https"
    allowed_methods        = ["GET", "HEAD"]
    cache_policy_id        = aws_cloudfront_cache_policy.repodata.id
    # (You can also specify an origin_request_policy_id if needed)
  }

  # ... (default_cache_behavior, etc.) ...
}```

[2025-05-15T18:40:22.774929] Juanje Ojeda: <@U04MGT65NQJ> <@U04NNGY4QQ2> I changed the upstream pipeline's nightly trigger, so it starts an hour earlier, to avoid having the bucket syncing when ppl is already using it.
I also changed the cache policy for the nightly directory, so it refresh every 3 hours, instead of every 12. If that new policy works and allow us to avoid the issue from this morning, we should move it to the infra repo, so we don't override it on the next deployment.
I think those two things should avoid any issues during the summit. I'll be checking on Monday anyway.

[2025-05-19T11:48:56.874329] Juanje Ojeda: The nightly clean up has been failing for a few days, it turns out that it was caused by the new AutoSD's bucket structure. The cleaning job was looking at the root of the bucket and not under `AutoSD-9/`. This made the command fail, which made the script fail and exit the job. So, it wasn't cleaning up the upstream nightlies, nor the downstream ones.
Here is a MR for fixing that. I tested it locally (without running the actual `aws s3 mv ..`) and it fox the issue:

Thanks for raising and taking care of AutoSD runners issue. 
Let’s be extra careful with AutoSD and keep a close eye out especially as tomorrow on Red Hat summit demo event <https://events.experiences.redhat.com/widget/redhat/sum25/SessionCatalog2025/session/1731489950376001pjgw|h><https://events.experiences.redhat.com/widget/redhat/sum25/SessionCatalog2025/session/1731489950376001pjgw|ere>  schedulaed Tuesday, May 20 10:30 AM - 12:00 PM EDT(US time) will heavily depend on AutoSD.
If the are any planned maintenance or work/changes that might risk AutoSD server functionality let’s postpone it after the summit tomorrow’s event.

Welcome back <@U0171SJF00H> :partydoge:
We just need to make sure AutoSD is ready for today's Summit Demo 10:30 AM - 12:00 PM EDT.
The main use case that's relevant to us/ATC is the building image via AIB part mentioned <https://github.com/rhpds/lab2255-software-templates/blob/main/templates/autosd-app-template/skeleton/src/images/build.sh#L22|here> as it points AIB to our <https://gitlab.com/CentOS/automotive/src/automotive-image-builder/-/blob/main/distro/autosd9.ipp.yml#L6|autosd URL> (which is the usual way AIB is working).
We should be fine but just to be on the safe side to check AIB related tasks are working well and we do not have any caching issues.

I did see an<https://redhat-internal.slack.com/archives/C05BYR06B0V/p1747724323814859?thread_ts=1747672277.834609&amp;cid=C05BYR06B0V| issue via UI (>does not seem related to the Demo as Demo/AIB is using curl) - not sure if it's a new/old issue.
If AIB is working well for the Demo, we can wait until we're changing anything else.

I will be on PTO tomorrow morning and from Thursday for about 10 days.
The MR removes duplicate code from 2 features: nightly pipelines and metrics, DUT pool monitoring.
Also working on the webserver code (autosd, rhivos and download mirror) which may be added to MR today.

[2025-06-09T13:55:44.294409] Hubert Stefanski: Hey <@U02JHD5HMGC> <@U04NLT3HY3Y> I've got this <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/infrastructure/-/merge_requests/548/diffs#83d339ca4da28d00335a8b5d4cd788440f860a19> to provision the VM on BOS2, I'm still a bit confused on how to deploy and configure flasher with tftp and other services that it relies on, do you have any existing playbooks or scripts that you use for it?

Ideally we can just drop them in at the end of this playbook to configure all of it via automation
[2025-06-12T09:48:08.914199] Michael Ho: <@U04MGT65NQJ> Can you take a look at <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/infrastructure/-/merge_requests/551> please?
[2025-06-12T15:20:43.683709] Nisha Saini: Hi SMEs,

You may also refer to a completed renewal ticket: <https://issues.redhat.com/browse/SOAR-3622>.
Please reach out to me if you have any questions.
[2025-06-17T11:58:38.598089] Juanje Ojeda: <@U0171SJF00H> <@U04MGT65NQJ> did anyone changed the downstream workspace s3 bucket policy for the static website? it looks like now it's trying to redirect to https and failing due lack of proper cert:
<https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/downstream-pipelines-as-code/-/jobs/36132306>
Or can you think on another reason for that error?
[2025-06-17T13:48:44.411939] Hubert Stefanski: :howdy: <@U04MGT65NQJ>, <@UFB1TK0Q7> reached out to me requesting a new ec2 instance for the rhivos dashboard, since you're more in the loop around the VPCs and subnets, which one can I use to create that ec2 in? and how many addresses do we have left in it? I don't want to consume one from the already strained runner pool is all
[2025-06-18T09:09:31.076869] Michael Ho: <@U04MGT65NQJ> I'd like to try switch the FoA runners to the general compute ec2 type, m6a. Can you take a look at <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/infrastructure/-/merge_requests/561> please? Thank you.
[2025-06-18T13:09:01.382619] Ozan Unsal: <@U04MGT65NQJ> <@U0171SJF00H> I have created <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/infrastructure/-/merge_requests/564|MR> according to our e-mail thread. Is it enough to add rhivos.git to terraform?
[2025-06-18T14:03:59.452019] Michael Ho: <@U0171SJF00H> I need to remount <https://rhivos.auto-toolchain.redhat.com/evidence-warehouse/> to a different bucket. Can you help?
[2025-06-19T09:54:06.475879] Hubert Stefanski: :howdy:  <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/infrastructure/-/merge_requests/567> straightforward review for anyone willing, this just adds cost center tags, we don't have an immediate use for them ourselves, but they're synced back to some centralized service somwhere that I'm now forgetting the name for
[2025-06-19T13:05:19.564229] Hubert Stefanski: <@U04MGT65NQJ> Do we have anything to discuss on todays Infra call? Think we got most of the current issues discussed during yesterdays 1:1?
[2025-06-19T13:06:33.201379] Hubert Stefanski: <@U04JRTQ4LHK> <@UFB1TK0Q7> <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/services/supply-chain-webserver/-/merge_requests/47/diffs>
I caught up on our rhivos webserver situation, seems like this is the only change we need to do :)

Hi everyone, Could I get some ACKs <https://gitlab.com/redhat/edge/ci-cd/pipe-x/tools/auto-toolchain-containers/-/merge_requests/90|here> as you have time?
[2025-06-30T10:16:58.776329] Ozan Unsal: GitLab CI pipelines
Title: promote-koji-builds (#10509117358) · Jobs · Red Hat / Edge / ci-cd / Pipe X / pipelines-as-code · GitLab
<@U04JRTQ4LHK> do you have any idea about who created `CBS_ATCBOT_SSL_CERT`  certificate for cbs koji? We are having certificate expired error in upstream pipeline, so we should renew the certificate <https://gitlab.com/redhat/edge/ci-cd/pipe-x/pipelines-as-code/-/jobs/10509117358>. I am trying to get some information about how to renew this certificate. I will be glad, if you have any idea about this :smile:
[2025-07-08T16:26:18.591839] Juanje Ojeda: Can I have some reviews here? <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/infrastructure/-/merge_requests/579>
[2025-07-08T16:40:24.516679] Juanje Ojeda: <@U0171SJF00H> qq, how do we manage the users/members in projects for gitlab.cee?
I added a project to pipe-x, but I need to add a maintainer that is not in our ldap group :thinking_face:
Do I do it manually or do we manage those cases with tf as well. I didn't see anything in other projects, but maybe I missed it.
[2025-07-08T16:42:42.591669] Hubert Stefanski: It's in <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/infrastructure/-/blob/main/gitlab/cee/modules/toolchain/group_pipe-x.tf?ref_type=heads>

the common name (cn) corresponds to the rover group name, so whatever group level you need to add users, either add them to the respective group in rover, or create a new rover group and refer to it in a new `gitlab_group_ldap_link` for the specific gitlab project, or gitlab repo you want
[2025-07-08T16:48:01.468479] Juanje Ojeda: I wanted to add them just to that project, which is under pipe-x, but I didn't want to add them to our rover group, just to that project.
[2025-07-08T16:54:46.960349] Hubert Stefanski: <https://registry.terraform.io/providers/gitlabhq/gitlab/latest/docs/resources/project_membership>
Then this would be the way to do it, refer to the project (through the terraform module with dot notation) and the user ID and their access level
[2025-07-08T17:05:13.656399] Michael Ho: Did you try asking AI first before asking Hubert???
[2025-07-08T17:05:19.978219] Michael Ho: We need to optimise
[2025-07-08T17:07:24.296819] Hubert Stefanski: Real Stupidity &gt; Artifical Intelligence :think_1:
[2025-07-08T17:08:04.964549] Hubert Stefanski: Actually there is a notebookLM with the infra repo loaded in
[2025-07-08T17:08:19.045869] Hubert Stefanski: so Maybe it would work? but maybe it also needs to have context of the terraform provider as a whole
[2025-07-08T17:10:24.152999] Juanje Ojeda: > Did you try asking AI first before asking Hubert???
I didn't, but I doubt the AI knows about our conventions. Maybe that NotebookLM does :thinking_face:  But as we didn't have any examples, it probably doesn't
[2025-07-08T17:15:45.368979] Michael Ho: We should put the notebooklm with the infra repo loaded in into the readme for that repo
[2025-07-08T17:15:50.604819] Michael Ho: As in linked there I mean
[2025-07-08T17:16:00.753619] Michael Ho: So someone who jumps into that repo can quickly head off to the notebooklm to ask it questions
[2025-07-08T17:21:47.011189] Juanje Ojeda: This should work, right? <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/infrastructure/-/merge_requests/580>
[2025-07-08T17:23:03.347709] Hubert Stefanski: Should, let's see what the terraform plan says
[2025-07-08T17:23:21.821279] Juanje Ojeda: does that notebook has also the terraform docs? that would make it more powerful
[2025-07-08T17:26:27.986729] Hubert Stefanski: I think those documents are directly compiled from git repos for each provider, so maybe we could repomix it
[2025-07-08T17:26:36.525479] Hubert Stefanski: I tried adding the URL directly but that failed
[2025-07-08T17:27:01.451949] Michael Ho: :brainintensifies: :notebooklm:
[2025-07-08T17:28:14.130679] Juanje Ojeda: I asked notebooklm and answered me kinda the same as the first response from hubes, but a bit more verbose :thinking_face:
[2025-07-08T17:28:44.666599] Michael Ho: s/but a bit more verbose/but better/g :sweat_smile:
[2025-07-08T17:28:50.260469] Michael Ho: jk
[2025-07-08T17:40:19.814169] Juanje Ojeda: It worked :slightly_smiling_face: Thanks
[2025-07-10T12:09:19.666469] Hubert Stefanski: Does anyone have experience with sonarqube?
For context: <https://sonarqube.corp.redhat.com/account/projects> was set up by Eitan on the infra repo, i'm trying to merge a change that technically has a security violation (not really, it's fully reasonable in my opinion) but I need admin privileges for the project (pipe-x/infra) in order to review the security concern and make it pass gating
Eitan is on PTO today, so he'll probably answer me on Sunday, but just thought to pop this question out there to see if anyone encountered this before
[2025-07-10T12:10:32.733679] Michael Ho: me puts on leadership hat: "Could we somehow give AI the privileges??"
[2025-07-10T12:11:32.094999] Hubert Stefanski: If AI makes browsing "The Source" less infuriating, i'm all for it
[2025-07-10T12:12:34.540249] Hubert Stefanski: :tableflip:
[2025-07-10T12:13:14.936699] Hubert Stefanski: 1. Query for a topic in the Source
2. Find somethjing that sounds exactly like what you need
3. Click the link and it's 50/50 on permissions denied or not found

[2025-07-11T11:52:44.325349] Ryan Smith: Hi everyone, could I get some ACKs on <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/infrastructure/-/merge_requests/585|this MR> to un-break infra pipelines?
[2025-07-14T08:05:05.753579] Hubert Stefanski: Hey <@U020YLADEKA> or <@U02F2L89YTS> I'm trying to get access to sonarqube
According to the response I got here: <https://redhat.service-now.com/help?id=rh_ticket&amp;table=incident&amp;sys_id=121a25ab3322a618c8c5abb13d5c7be4>  either of you two should have ownership, I'm not aware if either of you set it up in the first place, I thought it inherited permissions from gitlab, but apparently not (since I would have them as an owner of infra repo and the parent namespace)
[2025-07-14T09:13:30.629999] Avihai Efrat: Hi <@U0171SJF00H> , 
Juanje is on on leave till mid Aug.
I believe <@U04MGT65NQJ> or <@U04QNH25QA1> might know more around Sonarqube (I did not set it up)
[2025-07-14T10:21:14.842949] Avihai Efrat: Let me check the ticket as well ...
I was not aware I was the owners of this project as I did not do anything with Sonarqube but as manager someone might have wrote my as owner which is OK :slightly_smiling_face:

<@U0171SJF00H> Let me know how can I assist or what to change to help you out.
Can you send me the URL to SonarQube and I'll give it a shot
[2025-07-14T12:35:53.481759] Michael Ho: Hi <@U04MGT65NQJ>, how can we move the registration of our self hosted runners from <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/contcert/foa-validators/> to <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/contcert> ?
[2025-07-14T15:02:22.409799] Eitan Raviv: <@U04JRTQ4LHK> you need to:
• change the group reference of the <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/infrastructure/-/blob/main/gitlab/cee/runners.tf?ref_type=heads#L77|foa runner registration>  to the concert group and push a new commit
• after `tf apply` is executed by the merge, download the app-state and extract the runner token (according to the runner name) [1]
• replace the new token in the <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/infrastructure/-/settings/ci_cd|ci-cd> variable named CONFIG_TF_VAR of the `aws-internal` environment (this variable contains a map. replace the value of the `foa_validators_ds_pool_runner_token` entry). This is for future redeployments via terraform.
• ssh to each FoA ec2s and unregister the runner [2]
• re-register the runners to concert using the new token[3] then check that the runner <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/groups/automotive/contcert/-/runners> shows the registrations
• if you need to enlarge the <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/infrastructure/-/blame/main/aws-internal/main.tf?ref_type=heads#L221|number of instances> in the pool please do so via an MR and not manually. please note that there are currently only 6 free IPs available on the subnet where the pool is deployed so you cannot add more instances than that. I am working on <https://issues.redhat.com/browse/VROOM-30683|enlarging> it.
[1] aws s3api get-object --bucket "toolchain-tfstate" --key "gitlab-app-state" "./app-state"
[2] sudo gitlab-runner unregister --all-runners
[3] cat /tmp/log.txt | grep 'gitlab-runner register' and using the new token run the command with sudo
[2025-07-15T06:12:47.168169] Bot-B04R3KAN: Sorry, <@U020YLADEKA>. I couldn't find information about `give me a summery of this thread`. I've saved your query so I can continue to learn. Here are a couple things you can try right now:

1.) Type `/feedback` to provide Shadowbot feedback
2.) Type `concierge` to talk with some humans
3.) Click *<https://source.redhat.com/?search=give+me+a+summery+of+this+thread|here>* to search on source
[2025-07-24T14:30:39.112929] Hubert Stefanski: <@U04MGT65NQJ> Do you want to mvoe our Pipeline-Infra office hours to now? if you're around?
[2025-07-24T14:30:53.273529] Eitan Raviv: sure, let's
[2025-07-24T14:30:58.780429] Eitan Raviv: 2 minutes
[2025-07-30T12:35:47.296819] Ozan Unsal: <@U04MGT65NQJ> <@U0171SJF00H> do you know what happened to webserver <https://rhivos.auto-toolchain.redhat.com/> ? The builds are not mounted
[2025-07-30T12:48:20.470789] Eitan Raviv: Fixed
[2025-07-30T12:50:54.379609] Ozan Unsal: thanks Eitan, what was the issue?
[2025-07-30T13:26:12.020959] Eitan Raviv: I can't find a reason why the container failed. But the keepalive service failed to restart it due to missing execute permissions on the keepalive script. This is very strange, because journalctl shows keepalive worked 8 days ago, which is after the server migration to the new subnet.
[2025-07-30T14:22:38.650459] Hubert Stefanski: I think this is ready for a review: <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/infrastructure/-/merge_requests/581>
Setting the groundwork for a near-future RHIVOS artifact server through cloudfront
[2025-07-31T12:16:02.864969] Ozan Unsal: <@U04MGT65NQJ> I guess container failed again, <https://rhivos.auto-toolchain.redhat.com/> we can't see the product builds
[2025-07-31T12:23:25.614159] Eitan Raviv: up and running. for some reason the keepalive service is not picking the failure up on its own, only when invoked manually. i will investigate
[2025-07-31T12:26:58.200329] Ryan Smith: Just wanted to raise that the intermittent availability of the web server has been causing issues in FoA validator runs while we're trying to prepare our milestone submission report.
[2025-07-31T14:27:56.892129] Michael Ho: The server is having issues again
[2025-07-31T14:28:03.031639] Michael Ho: This is really hampering our 3.5 submission...
[2025-07-31T14:49:18.456289] Michael Ho: It appears to have been restarted just now - Sergei is proceeding with validator re-runs for submission 3.5 - we will ping here if the server goes down again.
[2025-07-31T14:49:55.445389] Michael Ho: <@U020YLADEKA> FYI
[2025-07-31T14:59:48.594219] Avihai Efrat: <@U04MGT65NQJ> <@U0171SJF00H> can we drop all the rest of the work and give the RHIVOS webserver attention and priority so it's fixed for good ?
All the rest can wait until this is resolved.
[2025-07-31T15:00:55.243319] Avihai Efrat: I know you are busy with many other incoming requests as well and thank you both Eitan and Hubert for all your hard work so far :pray:
[2025-07-31T15:01:56.017489] Eitan Raviv: I think the container is facing a load issue with both FoA accessing it and a heavy load from QE download right now (the one Priyanka asked to help me with). I am trying to figure out where the bottleneck is exactly
[2025-07-31T15:04:25.105529] Hubert Stefanski: can we increase the size? i hope the bottleneck isn't the s3 fs mount from goofys
[2025-07-31T15:05:23.344479] Eitan Raviv: the size of?
[2025-07-31T15:09:00.640959] Michael Ho: Please don't touch it right now as Sergei is running validators
[2025-08-03T21:04:52.581289] Hubert Stefanski: <@U04AXB4GK52> <@U04JRTQ4LHK> there's an email CC'd to you in your inboxes, looks like a contcert token for JIRA created in the auto-cki-bot account is about to expire, double-messaging just in case, also thanks <@U04MGT65NQJ> for spotting it (my filters are too good and it got thrown away into a labeleld drawer)
[2025-08-04T08:39:05.776569] Michael Ho: Aha, thank you.

[2025-08-05T11:21:40.215429] Hubert Stefanski: Looks like a bulk of the work was done for us WRT IAM auditing
[2025-08-05T11:22:20.480219] Hubert Stefanski: Tab 3  "Access Key Issues" even highlights best guess owners
[2025-08-05T11:22:35.718849] Hubert Stefanski: We still need to send this out to a wider audience to have people self-report ownership before we start the rotation
[2025-08-06T13:10:13.915099] Hubert Stefanski: Vibe coded rhivos-cloudfront <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/infrastructure/-/merge_requests/602/diffs> (at least the first part of it, there's other MRs) (<@U04MGT65NQJ> if you can take a look)
[2025-08-06T13:10:23.965189] Hubert Stefanski: overall the approach here makes sense, but I might be echo chambering myself, so LMK
[2025-08-07T09:03:34.715589] Hubert Stefanski: :wave:<@U04MGT65NQJ>, <@U04QNH25QA1> wants to add a new project in our gitlab terraform config, but seems like his plan is overwriting some of your recent changes <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/infrastructure/-/jobs/38397638> thought you might want to check on those before we merge it
[2025-08-07T14:21:51.742799] Ozan Unsal: <@U04MGT65NQJ> <@U0171SJF00H> I was checking monthly builds for AutoSD and I cannot see the monthly build in webserver <https://autosd.sig.centos.org/AutoSD-9/monthly/>, although I can see it in S3 bucket. Do you have any idea?
[2025-08-07T14:23:13.368619] Ozan Unsal: I mean `autosd9-202508010003` is missing in webserver
[2025-08-07T14:30:15.387459] Hubert Stefanski: I'll put that on my todo list
[2025-08-07T15:37:10.302469] Tomas Golembiovsky: <@U04MGT65NQJ> Do you still need this one or can we close it? <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/contcert/foa-validators/dbus-broker-tests/-/merge_requests/23>
[2025-08-08T11:42:40.619919] Ozan Unsal: Hey <@U0171SJF00H> I guess there is an issue with the cloudfront. Since I can see today's nightly build in S3  but it is not available in webserver <https://autosd.sig.centos.org/AutoSD-9/>
[2025-08-11T09:57:31.197379] Ozan Unsal: Hi <@U0171SJF00H> <@U04MGT65NQJ>, is there any update regarding to builds in <https://autosd.sig.centos.org/AutoSD-9/>. I still see the last build from Aug 1st, although there are builds for Aug 9th, 10th and 11th in S3 bucket
[2025-08-11T10:00:25.853409] Hubert Stefanski: Fighting fires, looking into that now though.
[2025-08-12T07:45:03.613439] Hubert Stefanski: Can we get one more review/approval here please? <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/infrastructure/-/merge_requests/617>
[2025-08-12T09:39:22.795629] Hubert Stefanski: And another one for reviews
<https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/infrastructure/-/merge_requests/616>
This one cleans up orphaned directories (ones that don't exist in s3 anymore) so they won't be indexed on the webserver and cause confusion when they get redireted to a non-existent clodfront artifact
[2025-08-12T09:44:44.903639] Ozan Unsal: I can see the latest builds in <https://autosd.sig.centos.org/AutoSD-9/> thanks <@U0171SJF00H> for fixing it.
[2025-08-12T10:25:20.207649] Ozan Unsal: <@U04MGT65NQJ>, <@U0171SJF00H> any idea why this job couldn't be started <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/downstream-pipelines-as-code/-/jobs/38598477>?
[2025-08-12T10:37:34.580019] Hubert Stefanski: initially, no idea why, we might need to look into the runner logs
[2025-08-12T10:42:48.543219] Ozan Unsal: I was checking EC2 instances for us-east-2 region and there is only one instance and the status is stopped <https://us-east-2.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home?region=us-east-2#Instances>:
[2025-08-12T10:50:36.405279] Hubert Stefanski: Those runners are served from the aws-internal account
[2025-08-12T10:50:46.640109] Hubert Stefanski: think you might be looking at the "public" one
[2025-08-12T10:51:30.357349] Hubert Stefanski: <@U04MGT65NQJ> are these instances plugged into splunk in any way? just wondering if I need to ssh into them to see the logs, or if theres a splunk index for it
[2025-08-12T10:56:47.795179] Eitan Raviv: there are splunk indexes for them. see <https://dashboard.auto-toolchain.redhat.com/resources> VHCL-008 monitoring
[2025-08-12T11:04:01.181849] Eitan Raviv: I see errors on both runners. analyzing
[2025-08-12T11:10:03.021669] Hubert Stefanski: <@U04QNH25QA1> also found this on the infra repo <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/infrastructure/-/pipelines/12520559>
[2025-08-12T11:17:31.541329] Eitan Raviv: on one of the two instances, I was trying out something. this is probably the reason for the error that Roni saw on the infra repo. I will regenerate the instance so pipelines can continue. On the other instance there is an error which I can't find a reason for.
[2025-08-12T12:41:15.855739] Hubert Stefanski: :howdy: <@U04QNH25QA1> needs one more review here to resolve part of the issue he discussed in the Open Sync meeting just now
<https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/infrastructure/-/merge_requests/618>
[2025-08-12T13:17:30.697599] Hubert Stefanski: <@U04MGT65NQJ> Do you remember the IT ticket we had to increase our resource quotas on MP+ ?
[2025-08-12T13:17:50.012369] Hubert Stefanski: I just wanna take a peek at that to file one for Roni for TC
[2025-08-12T14:14:06.983159] Hubert Stefanski: one review/approval here from anyone willing :)
<https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/infrastructure/-/merge_requests/620>
[2025-08-12T15:48:58.692569] Roni Eliezer: <@U0171SJF00H> <@U04MGT65NQJ> I got the following error (<https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/services/test-console/-/jobs/38614821>):
```fatal: unable to access '<https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/services/test-console.git/>': Error while processing content unencoding: invalid stored block lengths```
[2025-08-14T12:28:59.570559] Michael Ho: Just following up on our discussion in the auto-toolchain team meeting, did we now increase the size of the RHIVOS webserver ec2 instance?
[2025-08-18T11:52:44.391369] Roni Eliezer: Hi we get the following error when uploading to S3 bucket any idea?
```Unable to locate credentials```
[2025-08-18T12:02:38.208829] Avihai Efrat: Can we somehow add the script output link (stats )  to the ATC dashboard monitoring per service resource page <https://dashboard.auto-toolchain.redhat.com/resources|here>?
[2025-08-18T12:04:53.477909] Avihai Efrat: Make sense <@U04JRTQ4LHK>, if it's too much work to add it there leave it
[2025-08-18T18:54:37.959979] Avihai Efrat: Thank you <@U04MGT65NQJ> for pulling the data from current web server instances .

About priority:
My point before was to get the baseline monitoring on the current and past webserver availability and issues as one of our critical ATC services and part of Infrastructure availability improvements (AUTOBU-886).
<@U04MGT65NQJ> can you add an Epic for monitoring the RHIVOS webserver service ? 
We will also need to keep monitoring it after we switch to cloudfront and pulp (which will take a while especially with pulp VPN blockers for DS)

This will help us with understanding how much we improved (hopefully) by moving to cloud front so we should definitely be investing in it .

<@U04NN2GEXLZ> please correct me if I’m off about monitoring this service not on the top priority list.
[2025-08-19T16:02:50.189599] Petr Sabata: For this initiative for sure; we need to figure out what to monitor and how to monitor it to get some baseline data.
[2025-08-21T12:35:56.001549] Juanje Ojeda: <@U0171SJF00H> I think it's time to implement this. I was thinking on taking this tasks. I might refine the ticket to specify that it should be a job in the upstream pipeline, but I think this capture the task.
Would you ming to review it and give me your blasing to work on that? hehe

I've left some more context in the MR description
[2025-08-26T13:20:07.280419] Ozan Unsal: I have a dumb question, can we create gitlab runners close to iad2 datacenter for downstream generate-compose job? Since the generated composes are stored there <https://download-01.beak-001.prod.iad2.dc.redhat.com/odcs/prod/odcs-4399323/> maybe having runners closer to this region shortens the compose download time.
[2025-08-28T13:04:52.871119] Hubert Stefanski: <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/infrastructure/-/merge_requests/632> One more review, the merge in !602 had some Terraform apply failures, these should fix that..

[2025-09-01T06:40:31.838869] Luigi Pellecchia: Hi everyone,
I was thinking to change Test Console OpenShift strategy configuration from Recreate to Rolling to avoid disruptions in user experience during deployment updates. wdyt? Is there any reason we are using Recreate or any concerns on using Rolling?
[2025-09-01T07:23:37.632509] Hubert Stefanski: No specific reason IIRC, though if you're planning on major updates and major incompatibilities between versions, I'd say keep recreate, but if it's a fairly "clean" update, then no obstacles to rolling
[2025-09-01T12:39:37.297579] Hubert Stefanski: The previous cloudfront apply failed again :sad_meow:
<https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/infrastructure/-/merge_requests/635>
this one should hopefully fix that...
[2025-09-01T14:30:38.607719] Hubert Stefanski: I really hope this is the last one <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/infrastructure/-/merge_requests/637> my sanity is begging for it
[2025-09-01T15:11:33.380549] Hubert Stefanski: Spoiler alert: it wasn't ....

[2025-09-01T15:12:16.374249] Hubert Stefanski: I'll try to set this up manually instead of fidgeting with terraform, maybe that way I'll at least get something deployed and then re-applied retroactively to that config, so I don't need to bother anyone anymore (for a while)
[2025-09-01T15:19:05.286519] Juanje Ojeda: I find that way always shorter and less troublesome (unless it's a straightforward change) for infra changes

[2025-09-05T11:34:09.610479] Ryan Smith: Seems internal Nexus is down right now - nothing shows up in outage-list about this so Im going to report to middleware
[2025-09-05T11:45:39.107349] Ryan Smith: There is ongoing network maintenance in the IAD2 data center today that seems to be affecting RERC availability. According to outage list the scheduled maintenance window is over at 1400UTC and things should be okay then

[2025-09-08T08:42:33.817199] Robert O'Brien: Good morning, the ATC dashboard expired on Friday.  No issues on Firefox, but I'd like to fix the issue.
I've looked at the dashboard code, the RH certs there expire in 2055.
When I run locally, the webpage is not secured.
the gitlab-ci.yml includes pipeline-as-code gitlab files, but I haven't found what I'm looking for.
Anyone here any suggestions on how to update a cert for ATC dashboard?
[2025-09-08T08:49:38.243669] Hubert Stefanski: &gt; certs there expire in 2055
Cool, so we're covered for the next 30 years :wink:  (jk, I know it's a typo)
So, generally that process isn't difficult, but the first step is to re-submit a certificate request to IT. let me find the docs for that

But I checked and there are available runners, any idea?
[2025-09-16T11:23:23.157859] Hubert Stefanski: <@U02JHD5HMGC> you're going to have to re-submit that CSR with a proper cname in the request, <@U04NNGY4QQ2> noticed you requested <http://atcdashboard-rhivos.int.paas.dev.redhat.com|atcdashboard-rhivos.int.paas.dev.redhat.com>
[2025-09-16T11:23:56.756869] Hubert Stefanski: this time around please note the private key you use to generate the csr, we'll need that when we add it to the deployment, also the cname should match the current dashboard url
[2025-09-16T13:22:15.984819] Hubert Stefanski: :howdy: can I get one more approval here? <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/infrastructure/-/merge_requests/645>

[2025-09-17T09:58:43.724919] Eitan Raviv: Hi <!channel>,
Attn: If you are accessing AWS from the command line manually or programmaticaly

We have recently received a communication from IT that we should change the way we login to AWS from the command line. Using static personal users is no longer allowed starting November, and SSO should be used instead. I have created a <https://spaces.redhat.com/x/C4BTKQ|page> that explains how to migrate and I will also give a demonstration in the Toolchain Demo this afternoon.  Please take a few minutes to complete the migration for your personal user if you have one, because starting November, IT will automatically delete AWS users risking lockout. Also please alert me on the <https://issues.redhat.com/browse/VROOM-31311|Jira Epic> comments to any use cases you might have around using static AWS credentials so that I can address them in time.
Thanks a lot

[2025-09-19T09:00:10.671219] Luigi Pellecchia: It was announced somewhere the introduction of SonarQube?

[2025-10-01T12:36:04.781299] Juanje Ojeda: BTW, now that we're cleaning/renaming things, maybe we should rename the `supply-chain-webserver` repo to `rhivos-webserver`, which is how we normally refers to and that is more clear.
WDYT?

There is very little left under it, but in particular <http://download.eng.bos.redhat.com|download.eng.bos.redhat.com>. Anything still using that should have been updated to <http://download-01.beak-001.prod.iad2.dc.redhat.com|download-01.beak-001.prod.iad2.dc.redhat.com> by this point.

[2025-10-03T09:52:11.647139] Hubert Stefanski: to fix the issue yesterday, I hate how terraform validation doesn't actually validate against the API in a dry-run mode... maybe pebkac though, but dissapointing that to catch some of these conflicts, you have to run apply...

[2025-10-07T10:10:39.049059] Luigi Pellecchia: HI everyone,
thinking on moving Test Console deployment from Recreate to Rolling I see we need to have at least 2 replicas.
With 1 replicas Rolling will behaves as Recreate is doing.
I'm asking if it is possible to scale replicas to 2 as I assume that can impact the dedicated/resources budget for this cluster.

[2025-10-07T10:24:45.249009] Hubert Stefanski: yes, we'll have to file a ticket with IT openshift, they'll need to increase our quota, we're riding on the edge of it right now, but IIRC it wasn't a big deal for them to do so in prior engagements

&gt;  We’ve detected that your account is regularly making authenticated requests to the <http://GitLab.com|GitLab.com> API in excess of our published rate limit of <https://gslink.gitlab.com/ls/click?upn=u001.Z-2FLxiSxBJrdCYEDao1-2B4O0w6VWorXbTPAGlGVekwo7j17yUOiZR-2B-2BrruSHoz2cvmVFwQW-2FxObSat0LEL3mihFxqeCKGBCDeg95f07CqF-2BEI-3DJFYY_3Va5eXzMcsAFZ7WxyK6EESay-2BFwdAmv0ezWJ-2F3JaFTjyIAedBOiOgtD7isaOtmuA2PNkJlPwE0avzy39M9A8LNLVBB1s0khXJg6s4s8ukUSPOvloFNqw-2B9ZSga2357uXVczjVioUmnmalvQQA8FMcw-2BnyEFGMV3kbPGoAQkXcgiOu6nkKv-2BZXV7rd-2FplnHaa-2Bp-2FT6H48Bic6kmAz3QNuxzrWTUM431Dr-2BPeiWnVwvNPmrFFTeNu1uQ6PhTdn88HlyXynKu-2BjQnzhH52czt18Bv3SeKwpWWZ0NL1mcgoiJoWMAqzn2UKlQ3Js0iYRTPDIdIC6kOUYKho-2BDgCIMuW-2FaqHhUV9mXUhQCD2hEysrshzRCMtKxWLSYPc5xkjyC7PKoKLrmRuUoX3PnL-2BS8MvK-2BFn7OcMOG8nu7tAaaUf9IdT7pR0SgA9Qt9MUtrUDbCiKmnbRlrTF3T1cn-2BpOIDvKZGpPuirMQc2xCOWo0yLT7yrcpMRIQBroMWzMjaZLkf2O|2000 requests per minute>. Our logs show that over a week’s time, your account is making up to 100,000 requests in excess of the rate limit.
&gt;  
&gt; As a temporary grace period, we are currently allowing your account to make up to 8000 requests per minute. However, this grace period will end on *November 17, 2025*, when we will begin enforcing our published rate limit of 2000 requests per minute.  
&gt; In advance of this date, we will enforce the rate limit of 2000 requests per minute during two brief brownout periods. These brownouts are for your benefit, allowing you to monitor how your integrations respond to the rate limits. 
&gt; *What does this rate limit do?*
&gt;  
&gt; This rate limit applies to authenticated API requests to any <http://GitLab.com|GitLab.com> endpoint. Once a user reaches the rate limit, further requests will fail with a 429 response until the timer resets. This applies to GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests. 
&gt; *What action do you need to take?*
&gt; 1. We recommend the following actions to <https://gslink.gitlab.com/ls/click?upn=u001.Z-2FLxiSxBJrdCYEDao1-2B4O6M4scDflE2-2BigWvhrVxraPOpkoBdGphqbt5tqxnDq59qvwkZo-2FiwDIcUyJziBi2OvFm4c6-2FXOHBDQWKTFZPWUb2Zx96fpaCtHJW1xkwjzFTA5faHc4npIAtE63Ngf-2FGG1iOLSfkryOAqORukA8jKaI-3DNYxp_3Va5eXzMcsAFZ7WxyK6EESay-2BFwdAmv0ezWJ-2F3JaFTjyIAedBOiOgtD7isaOtmuA2PNkJlPwE0avzy39M9A8LNLVBB1s0khXJg6s4s8ukUSPOvloFNqw-2B9ZSga2357uXVczjVioUmnmalvQQA8FMcw-2BnyEFGMV3kbPGoAQkXcgiOu6nkKv-2BZXV7rd-2FplnHaa-2Bp-2FT6H48Bic6kmAz3QNuxzrWTUM431Dr-2BPeiWnVwvNPmrFFTeNu1uQ6PhTdn88HlyXynKu-2BjQnzhH52czt18Bv3SeKwpWWZ0NL1mcgoiJoWMAqzn2UKlQ3Js0iYRTPDIdIC6kOUYKho-2BDgCIMuW-2FaqHhUV9mXUhQCD2hEysrshzRCMtKxWLSYPc5xkjyC7PKxrZG-2FEORRQKIXTzol0jJzraJizBlB8e-2F2sthUeyqCmnCSsiURTaS5b3aMtJQGFDO4knvrutwnYWg5wfUyBDv2Bj-2FMpkg3NOfXkBykpxGMvIvnYvhT5EDthpyk-2BKSa-2BR3|minimize the risk of hitting rate limits>:
&gt;     a. Implement exponential backoff and retry logic
&gt;     b. Stagger automated pipelines
&gt;     c. Implement request batching
&gt;     d. Implement caching
&gt;     e. Monitor for rate-limited responses
&gt; 2. During the brownout periods, monitor your integrations to ensure that they are handling the rate limiting appropriately. Make any adjustments needed to your integrations.
&gt; 3. Once the rate limit is applied permanently on November 17, 2025, monitor your integrations to ensure they continue to work as expected.
&gt; *When will the 2000 requests/min limit be enforced?*
&gt; • *2025-10-20* 09:00 UTC to 21:00 UTC (12 hours)
&gt; • *2025-11-03* 09:00 UTC to 2025-11-04 09:00 UTC (24 hours)
&gt; • *2025-11-17* 09:00 UTC Permanent enforcement

I believe its you folks using this account right? Just giving you a heads up in case you missed the email ^^
[2025-10-08T08:12:35.112109] Hubert Stefanski: But I'm also not 100% whether it's just you, 100,000 requests in excess seems like quite a lot..
[2025-10-08T08:47:46.198969] Michael Ho: It's us, I flagged this in foa team chat now and we have a discussion ongoing there
[2025-10-08T09:26:35.239889] Tomas Golembiovsky: It is 100,000 requests *over the week*. In our terms it is not that much. :smile:
[2025-10-08T09:27:28.116439] Michael Ho: &gt; your account is making up to 100,000 requests in excess of the rate limit.
But I think this is talking about our excess over the rate limit of 2000 requests per minute... :sweat_smile:
[2025-10-08T09:27:47.529669] Tomas Golembiovsky: yeah, it's like 10 requests excess over the minute :stuck_out_tongue:
[2025-10-08T09:27:59.654689] Michael Ho: Those greedy validators
[2025-10-08T09:28:11.274749] Michael Ho: Just a hair over..

[2025-10-08T10:38:54.339219] Michael Ho: unlimited memory, unlimited storage, unlimited cpu. We're living the true turing machine dream.
[2025-10-08T10:40:57.375799] Michael Ho: <@U0171SJF00H> For some fusa purposes, I need an aarch64 machine to run some builds with - <https://issues.redhat.com/browse/VROOM-32781>. Can toolchain provide me with an aws ec2? With a RHEL image would be primo. And enough cpu/memory power to build the kernel in reasonable time.
[2025-10-09T09:32:21.241509] Hubert Stefanski: Our S3 costs have tripled over the past few months, I'll need to investigate why, Some of this is expected as we're building multiple versions across streams, <@U02F2L89YTS> do you think that would account for the increase? Fine if so, just trying to get a rough idea before I dive deep into it at some point
