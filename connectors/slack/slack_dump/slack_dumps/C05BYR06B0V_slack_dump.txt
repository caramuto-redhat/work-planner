[2025-09-23T07:59:30.399679] Hubert Stefanski: May I get some eyes on <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/infrastructure/-/merge_requests/652>? the apply for !644 failed, unfortunately with terraform some fields aren't validated prior to hitting the API, so, sometimes we're left with this ugly "validated" but not "correct" terraform config...
[2025-09-23T11:05:20.295729] Hubert Stefanski: <@U02DXVBD5CP> I see you're having some unrelated pipeline failures in: <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/infrastructure/-/merge_requests/653>
[2025-09-23T11:06:02.107479] Hubert Stefanski: <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/infrastructure/-/merge_requests/649/diffs> Should fix the one of the changes in the plan
[2025-09-23T11:06:48.934179] Hubert Stefanski: as for the bucket failure, I'll address that now
[2025-09-25T05:30:39.372929] Kanitha Chim: one more review here pls <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/services/supply-chain-webserver/-/merge_requests/51>
[2025-09-29T03:44:51.545259] Roni Eliezer: Hi Good morning, I can't login to RHIVOS server, not sure if it's a known issue or my local issue:
[2025-09-29T05:41:00.361959] Michael Ho: <@U0171SJF00H> Do you want to double check <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/infrastructure/-/merge_requests/657> before I just hit merge?
[2025-10-01T09:31:03.273839] Juanje Ojeda: <@U02DXVBD5CP> I see you already added the `/mnt/buckets/in-vehicle-os` to the webserver, but I don't see it working. Was that change deployed?
<https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/services/supply-chain-webserver/-/commit/7f307213e08f818ddef7fda6df2d74163b52928a>
[2025-10-01T09:31:38.043239] Kanitha Chim: i haven't pulled that into ec2 and rebuild the container yet
[2025-10-01T09:31:48.103779] Juanje Ojeda: Ah, ok
[2025-10-01T09:32:03.713609] Kanitha Chim: sorry been busy with Errata stuff
[2025-10-01T09:32:19.794159] Juanje Ojeda: no worries, just worndering. Do you have a ticket for that chnage?
[2025-10-01T09:32:33.403799] Kanitha Chim: nope, I don't have
[2025-10-01T09:33:10.980699] Juanje Ojeda: Ok, I'll create one under this epic and we add your change and the deployment. Sounds good?
<https://issues.redhat.com/browse/VROOM-33349>
[2025-10-01T09:36:04.781299] Juanje Ojeda: BTW, now that we're cleaning/renaming things, maybe we should rename the `supply-chain-webserver` repo to `rhivos-webserver`, which is how we normally refers to and that is more clear.
WDYT?
[2025-10-01T09:38:44.816869] Kanitha Chim: it's fine by me
[2025-10-02T10:42:43.069549] Hubert Stefanski: getting dangerously close to merge request 666, but not quite there yet, <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/infrastructure/-/merge_requests/662> If anyone could take a look :)
[2025-10-02T11:34:01.180759] Hubert Stefanski: welp, that broke it :)
[2025-10-02T11:41:34.862439] Tomas Golembiovsky: And it wasn't even !666.
[2025-10-02T15:06:01.845249] Roni Eliezer: Hi, We can build containers because of this broken link <https://download.eng.bos.redhat.com/brewroot/vol/rhel-9/packages/lftp/4.9.2/7.el9/x86_64/lftp-4.9.2-7.el9.x86_64.rpm>
any idea?
[2025-10-02T15:56:23.986519] Michael Ho: afaiu the bos url has been deprecated
[2025-10-02T15:56:29.197249] Michael Ho: <https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DOS-457>
[2025-10-02T15:57:13.926979] Michael Ho: :announcement-megaphone-9636: :announcement-megaphone-9636:  ALL: I will be disabling the "<http://eng.bos.redhat.com|eng.bos.redhat.com>" domain  :announcement-megaphone-9636: :announcement-megaphone-9636:
There is very little left under it, but in particular <http://download.eng.bos.redhat.com|download.eng.bos.redhat.com>. Anything still using that should have been updated to <http://download-01.beak-001.prod.iad2.dc.redhat.com|download-01.beak-001.prod.iad2.dc.redhat.com> by this point.

[2025-10-03T06:03:31.035529] Hubert Stefanski: Well, that's surprising.. I heard nothing about that _at all_
[2025-10-03T06:51:37.015359] Hubert Stefanski: <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/infrastructure/-/merge_requests/663>
[2025-10-03T06:52:11.647139] Hubert Stefanski: to fix the issue yesterday, I hate how terraform validation doesn't actually validate against the API in a dry-run mode... maybe pebkac though, but dissapointing that to catch some of these conflicts, you have to run apply...
[2025-10-03T11:48:54.194579] Ryan Smith: Hi <@U04MGT65NQJ> and <@U0171SJF00H> if you're around to give :axe:  I would appreciate. This would help unblock our database synchronization process:

<https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/infrastructure/-/merge_requests/664>
[2025-10-03T12:39:15.338709] Ryan Smith: One more for aesthetics: <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/infrastructure/-/merge_requests/665>
[2025-10-07T07:10:39.049059] Luigi Pellecchia: HI everyone,
thinking on moving Test Console deployment from Recreate to Rolling I see we need to have at least 2 replicas.
With 1 replicas Rolling will behaves as Recreate is doing.
I'm asking if it is possible to scale replicas to 2 as I assume that can impact the dedicated/resources budget for this cluster.
cc <@U0171SJF00H>
[2025-10-07T07:24:45.249009] Hubert Stefanski: yes, we'll have to file a ticket with IT openshift, they'll need to increase our quota, we're riding on the edge of it right now, but IIRC it wasn't a big deal for them to do so in prior engagements
[2025-10-07T07:24:55.475399] Hubert Stefanski: I'll finish up lunch and find that form
[2025-10-07T08:43:49.778309] Kanitha Chim: <@U0171SJF00H> I have one comment here <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/infrastructure/-/merge_requests/548>, could you check?
[2025-10-07T10:00:56.179399] Ryan Smith: <@U0171SJF00H> or other - for some reason I'm not allowed to run my own manual job in <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/infrastructure/-/pipelines/13251357|this pipeline> can you or anyone else hit :arrow_forward:  on the job `deploy-ansible-mpp-contcert-prod`?
[2025-10-07T10:34:20.885169] Kanitha Chim: <@U02F2L89YTS> <@U0171SJF00H> here is the epic for copying GA to S3 bucket <https://issues.redhat.com/browse/VROOM-33481>

&gt;  We’ve detected that your account is regularly making authenticated requests to the <http://GitLab.com|GitLab.com> API in excess of our published rate limit of <https://gslink.gitlab.com/ls/click?upn=u001.Z-2FLxiSxBJrdCYEDao1-2B4O0w6VWorXbTPAGlGVekwo7j17yUOiZR-2B-2BrruSHoz2cvmVFwQW-2FxObSat0LEL3mihFxqeCKGBCDeg95f07CqF-2BEI-3DJFYY_3Va5eXzMcsAFZ7WxyK6EESay-2BFwdAmv0ezWJ-2F3JaFTjyIAedBOiOgtD7isaOtmuA2PNkJlPwE0avzy39M9A8LNLVBB1s0khXJg6s4s8ukUSPOvloFNqw-2B9ZSga2357uXVczjVioUmnmalvQQA8FMcw-2BnyEFGMV3kbPGoAQkXcgiOu6nkKv-2BZXV7rd-2FplnHaa-2Bp-2FT6H48Bic6kmAz3QNuxzrWTUM431Dr-2BPeiWnVwvNPmrFFTeNu1uQ6PhTdn88HlyXynKu-2BjQnzhH52czt18Bv3SeKwpWWZ0NL1mcgoiJoWMAqzn2UKlQ3Js0iYRTPDIdIC6kOUYKho-2BDgCIMuW-2FaqHhUV9mXUhQCD2hEysrshzRCMtKxWLSYPc5xkjyC7PKoKLrmRuUoX3PnL-2BS8MvK-2BFn7OcMOG8nu7tAaaUf9IdT7pR0SgA9Qt9MUtrUDbCiKmnbRlrTF3T1cn-2BpOIDvKZGpPuirMQc2xCOWo0yLT7yrcpMRIQBroMWzMjaZLkf2O|2000 requests per minute>. Our logs show that over a week’s time, your account is making up to 100,000 requests in excess of the rate limit.
&gt;  
&gt; As a temporary grace period, we are currently allowing your account to make up to 8000 requests per minute. However, this grace period will end on *November 17, 2025*, when we will begin enforcing our published rate limit of 2000 requests per minute.  
&gt; In advance of this date, we will enforce the rate limit of 2000 requests per minute during two brief brownout periods. These brownouts are for your benefit, allowing you to monitor how your integrations respond to the rate limits. 
&gt; *What does this rate limit do?*
&gt;  
&gt; This rate limit applies to authenticated API requests to any <http://GitLab.com|GitLab.com> endpoint. Once a user reaches the rate limit, further requests will fail with a 429 response until the timer resets. This applies to GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests. 
&gt; *What action do you need to take?*
&gt; 1. We recommend the following actions to <https://gslink.gitlab.com/ls/click?upn=u001.Z-2FLxiSxBJrdCYEDao1-2B4O6M4scDflE2-2BigWvhrVxraPOpkoBdGphqbt5tqxnDq59qvwkZo-2FiwDIcUyJziBi2OvFm4c6-2FXOHBDQWKTFZPWUb2Zx96fpaCtHJW1xkwjzFTA5faHc4npIAtE63Ngf-2FGG1iOLSfkryOAqORukA8jKaI-3DNYxp_3Va5eXzMcsAFZ7WxyK6EESay-2BFwdAmv0ezWJ-2F3JaFTjyIAedBOiOgtD7isaOtmuA2PNkJlPwE0avzy39M9A8LNLVBB1s0khXJg6s4s8ukUSPOvloFNqw-2B9ZSga2357uXVczjVioUmnmalvQQA8FMcw-2BnyEFGMV3kbPGoAQkXcgiOu6nkKv-2BZXV7rd-2FplnHaa-2Bp-2FT6H48Bic6kmAz3QNuxzrWTUM431Dr-2BPeiWnVwvNPmrFFTeNu1uQ6PhTdn88HlyXynKu-2BjQnzhH52czt18Bv3SeKwpWWZ0NL1mcgoiJoWMAqzn2UKlQ3Js0iYRTPDIdIC6kOUYKho-2BDgCIMuW-2FaqHhUV9mXUhQCD2hEysrshzRCMtKxWLSYPc5xkjyC7PKxrZG-2FEORRQKIXTzol0jJzraJizBlB8e-2F2sthUeyqCmnCSsiURTaS5b3aMtJQGFDO4knvrutwnYWg5wfUyBDv2Bj-2FMpkg3NOfXkBykpxGMvIvnYvhT5EDthpyk-2BKSa-2BR3|minimize the risk of hitting rate limits>:
&gt;     a. Implement exponential backoff and retry logic
&gt;     b. Stagger automated pipelines
&gt;     c. Implement request batching
&gt;     d. Implement caching
&gt;     e. Monitor for rate-limited responses
&gt; 2. During the brownout periods, monitor your integrations to ensure that they are handling the rate limiting appropriately. Make any adjustments needed to your integrations.
&gt; 3. Once the rate limit is applied permanently on November 17, 2025, monitor your integrations to ensure they continue to work as expected.
&gt; *When will the 2000 requests/min limit be enforced?*
&gt; • *2025-10-20* 09:00 UTC to 21:00 UTC (12 hours)
&gt; • *2025-11-03* 09:00 UTC to 2025-11-04 09:00 UTC (24 hours)
&gt; • *2025-11-17* 09:00 UTC Permanent enforcement

I believe its you folks using this account right? Just giving you a heads up in case you missed the email ^^
[2025-10-08T05:12:35.112109] Hubert Stefanski: But I'm also not 100% whether it's just you, 100,000 requests in excess seems like quite a lot..
[2025-10-08T05:47:46.198969] Michael Ho: It's us, I flagged this in foa team chat now and we have a discussion ongoing there
[2025-10-08T06:26:35.239889] Tomas Golembiovsky: It is 100,000 requests *over the week*. In our terms it is not that much. :smile:
[2025-10-08T06:27:28.116439] Michael Ho: &gt; your account is making up to 100,000 requests in excess of the rate limit.
But I think this is talking about our excess over the rate limit of 2000 requests per minute... :sweat_smile:
[2025-10-08T06:27:47.529669] Tomas Golembiovsky: yeah, it's like 10 requests excess over the minute :stuck_out_tongue:
[2025-10-08T06:27:59.654689] Michael Ho: Those greedy validators
[2025-10-08T06:28:11.274749] Michael Ho: Just a hair over..
[2025-10-08T06:29:14.310209] Tomas Golembiovsky: Who counts that these days? We have unlimited memory, unlimited storage, we're moving to the clouds baby! :cloudready:
[2025-10-08T07:25:30.531489] Hubert Stefanski: Ah, my bad, i don't check your channel :sweat_smile: great that you're on it already
[2025-10-08T07:38:54.339219] Michael Ho: unlimited memory, unlimited storage, unlimited cpu. We're living the true turing machine dream.
[2025-10-08T07:40:57.375799] Michael Ho: <@U0171SJF00H> For some fusa purposes, I need an aarch64 machine to run some builds with - <https://issues.redhat.com/browse/VROOM-32781>. Can toolchain provide me with an aws ec2? With a RHEL image would be primo. And enough cpu/memory power to build the kernel in reasonable time.
[2025-10-09T06:32:21.241509] Hubert Stefanski: Our S3 costs have tripled over the past few months, I'll need to investigate why, Some of this is expected as we're building multiple versions across streams, <@U02F2L89YTS> do you think that would account for the increase? Fine if so, just trying to get a rough idea before I dive deep into it at some point
[2025-10-09T08:34:02.427609] Hubert Stefanski: <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/infrastructure/-/merge_requests/670>

ezpz review for anyone :meow_pwettyplease:
[2025-10-15T11:15:41.304749] Juanje Ojeda: Is this token used by our infra `pipe-x/infrastructure-2025-09`?  It has expired.
[2025-10-16T11:18:32.484749] Hubert Stefanski: Small review: <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/services/s3gi/-/merge_requests/2>
[2025-10-16T11:18:51.193679] Hubert Stefanski: s3gi is the new indexer for the rhivos webserver, more info here: <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/services/s3gi/-/blob/main/README.md?ref_type=heads>
[2025-10-21T09:43:29.969759] Ozan Unsal: <@U0171SJF00H> <@U04MGT65NQJ> is there any update of AWS ACCESS KEY? Lifecycle jobs are failing due to the invalid AWS Access Key ID

<https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/scheduled-jobs/-/jobs/42029246>
Maybe the key is expired?
  ↳ [2025-10-21T09:44:14.981449] Hubert Stefanski: I think these are the same ones that we have in the downstream pipeline <@U04MGT65NQJ>
  ↳ [2025-10-21T10:13:14.354889] Eitan Raviv: updated to new key
  ↳ [2025-10-21T10:30:56.140899] Eitan Raviv: now passes again
[2025-10-22T06:32:32.406169] Roni Eliezer: Hi Team, we got this error in TC. Maybe the certificate has expired. Any idea how we can check it?
```botocore.exceptions.ClientError: An error occurred (AuthFailure) when calling the DescribeImages operation: AWS was not able to validate the provided access credentials```
  ↳ [2025-10-22T07:36:29.469159] Hubert Stefanski: <@U04MGT65NQJ> did you change these yet? maybe we just didn't deploy them :sweat_smile:
  ↳ [2025-10-22T07:44:25.408189] Eitan Raviv: <@U04QNH25QA1> can you post a link to the job where the failure is happening? thanks
  ↳ [2025-10-22T08:24:55.471479] Luigi Pellecchia: the failure is happening filing a new request
  ↳ [2025-10-22T08:25:04.928869] Luigi Pellecchia: and it is logged in the backend
  ↳ [2025-10-22T08:25:10.416689] Luigi Pellecchia: do you need a traceback?
  ↳ [2025-10-22T08:28:56.348339] Eitan Raviv: I have not found the key-pair I disabled on any of the TC repos [1]. Please LMK where the key-pair is defined so I can update it.
[1] <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/services/test-console>
<https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/services/test-console-frontend>
<https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/services/test-console-client>
  ↳ [2025-10-22T08:30:30.114289] Hubert Stefanski: ^^ all of those should be in the infra repo under their respective mpp environments
  ↳ [2025-10-22T08:32:05.694109] Eitan Raviv: I'll have a look, thanks
  ↳ [2025-10-22T08:45:57.805799] Eitan Raviv: <@U04Q4USRZTM> I updated the key pairs on the infra repo. You probably need to redeploy TC in order for this to take effect
  ↳ [2025-10-22T08:52:19.184579] Eitan Raviv: in the meantime I reactivated the old key-pair so the service is not down. LMK once the redeploy is over. thanks
  ↳ [2025-10-22T09:00:41.722469] Roni Eliezer: Hi sorry I was in a meeting
  ↳ [2025-10-22T09:02:56.854339] Roni Eliezer: <@U04MGT65NQJ> the keys are
TC_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
TC_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
  ↳ [2025-10-22T09:04:47.786549] Eitan Raviv: yep, those are the ones I updated for 3 envs: managed-platform-prod-basil-test-console, managed-platform-preprod-basil-test-console, managed-platform-dev-basil-test-console
  ↳ [2025-10-22T09:05:04.303659] Roni Eliezer: thx
  ↳ [2025-10-22T09:05:29.909259] Eitan Raviv: When does TC get redeployed?
  ↳ [2025-10-22T09:06:37.176769] Eitan Raviv: if its on MPP you can redeploy the pods manually right?
  ↳ [2025-10-22T09:06:47.663579] Roni Eliezer: I guess that it has already been deployed because it works:)
```sh-5.1$ aws s3 ls <s3://auto-product-build-downstream>
                           PRE PartnerUpload/
                           PRE RHIVOS-1/
                           PRE RHIVOS-2/
                           PRE package-gating-tests-results/ ```
  ↳ [2025-10-22T09:07:21.493349] Eitan Raviv: no, it works because I reactivated the old key pair so the service is not down until you redeploy

  ↳ [2025-10-22T09:07:41.662459] Eitan Raviv: once you redeploy I need to delete the old key-pair
  ↳ [2025-10-22T09:09:04.448009] Luigi Pellecchia: but we need to deploy it via Infrastructure right?
  ↳ [2025-10-22T09:09:27.191389] Roni Eliezer: I can deploy it manually
  ↳ [2025-10-22T09:09:50.613119] Luigi Pellecchia: it will take the new variables?
  ↳ [2025-10-22T09:10:22.118629] Eitan Raviv: actually yes, you need to deploy from the infra repo. otherwise the new variables will not be copied to MPP. manual restart of the pods will not work
  ↳ [2025-10-22T09:11:09.501209] Roni Eliezer: ok i run it here:
<https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/infrastructure/-/jobs/42098618>
  ↳ [2025-10-22T09:13:33.100049] Roni Eliezer: do we need to stop/start the pod after deloy?
  ↳ [2025-10-22T09:16:10.515029] Luigi Pellecchia: I see dev starting, should be ok

  ↳ [2025-10-22T09:16:40.729239] Eitan Raviv: ?
  ↳ [2025-10-22T09:16:49.954229] Luigi Pellecchia: do we have an expiration date for the new credentials?
  ↳ [2025-10-22T09:17:10.102269] Roni Eliezer: yes is it running ok now
  ↳ [2025-10-22T09:17:33.539509] Eitan Raviv: we have a new directive from IT to make sure all key-pairs are younger than 1 year. So we had to rotate them
  ↳ [2025-10-22T09:19:10.483169] Eitan Raviv: where on openshift is TC deployed? I can't find it on <https://console-openshift-console.apps.mpp-e1-prod.9e4s.p1.openshiftapps.com/k8s/cluster/projects?project-name=automotive|prod>
  ↳ [2025-10-22T09:19:38.594709] Hubert Stefanski: it's under basil-test-console-*
  ↳ [2025-10-22T09:20:19.627839] Hubert Stefanski: &gt;  do we have an expiration date for the new credentials?
yeah 12 months from the initial issue date. We're (well, Eitan mostly) is planning on a way to automate the rollout of new credentials prior to that expiration
  ↳ [2025-10-22T09:21:46.486119] Eitan Raviv: &gt; it's under basil-test-console-*
thanks but unfortunately I am denied access there. Can anybody add me? thanks
  ↳ [2025-10-22T09:22:54.339969] Eitan Raviv: BTW `basil` stands for Basil from Fawlty's Towers? :wink:
  ↳ [2025-10-22T09:25:04.787089] Hubert Stefanski: Sure, I think I have admin perms on that group :thinking_face:
  ↳ [2025-10-22T09:26:39.111559] Hubert Stefanski: Lol, you'll have to ask Luigi on the etymology of that title, :sweat_smile:  I think it was used for a while and then it got dropped to just `test-console` or I confused what it was when I requested the namespace
  ↳ [2025-10-22T09:26:57.500729] Hubert Stefanski: so it could be my "fawlt"(I will not apologise for this pun) that the namespace is named that way :p
  ↳ [2025-10-22T09:26:59.905959] Luigi Pellecchia: BASIL is this guy <https://github.com/elisa-tech/BASIL>
