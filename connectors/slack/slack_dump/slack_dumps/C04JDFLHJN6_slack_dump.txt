[2024-06-26T09:08:18.143669] U04JDAPLMSN: Hey folks, quick reminder to take a look at the MVP doc… and the Tech Preview column in there. Right now there are still quite some focus areas missing: <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cZjwPjezbJIzfAHlf_4c5SBPlhlo2gHBf4Q6wxn_aJk/edit#heading=h.tralhudtifq4>

Thanks!

[2024-07-02T14:48:45.108969] U04Q4USRZTM: Hi all,
do we have an issue with RideSX4 nightly image?

[2024-07-02T15:23:10.929309] UG0N57XEX: found this in testing-farm channel
[2024-07-04T09:17:37.415299] U02JHD5HMGC: Hi, our upstream nightly build failed due to disk space issue on the runners building the images.
Can we easily clean up space there?
Do we also need to create a ticket for something to keep the runners clean?  It's not a regular occurrence, but it's a blocker when it happens.
[2024-07-04T13:59:30.675209] U02JHD5HMGC: Due to PTO and weekend for some colleagues, this channel will have limited cover on Friday 5th July.
If you do have an issue, please do use the channel.  It may be Sunday or Monday before you get response or resolution.
[2024-07-04T14:01:50.320729] U02F2L89YTS: Yep, as a summary, it's not a runner issue, but the instances used by Testing Farm for the build jobs.
[2024-07-04T16:05:50.024579] U02F2L89YTS: <@U02JHD5HMGC> <@U04NNGY4QQ2> <@U04QNH25QA1> <@UJJV82KRP> could you approve this MR? <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/scheduled-jobs/-/merge_requests/45>
It's for unblocking the job that clean up the nightlies and fix our problem with the upstream webserver and the nightly broken there.
[2024-07-04T19:14:45.220059] U02F2L89YTS: At the end, the problem was different. It seems like the content for the QM and the QA images is larger now.
For the QM, it doesn't fit at the default 8 Gb image size defined by default. Well, it's probably due to the partitioning. I guess one of the partition is the one that get full.

For the other image that fails, the problem is different. It's the QA for rpi4. For that image we sat a smaller image size (3.9 GB), but now it seems to be too small.

I tested both images locally and I could reproduce the error. I also was able to fix the error by setting a new image size.

This MR has the fix. It should solve the problem and fix the upstream pipeline.
<https://gitlab.com/redhat/edge/ci-cd/pipe-x/pipelines-as-code/-/merge_requests/318>
[2024-07-05T15:13:21.502159] UG137FY4U: Are current AutoSD nightly builds for RPi expected to work? My attempt seems to be hanging at the boot screen.
[2024-07-05T15:20:05.025459] UG137FY4U: Alright, even with the boot screen apparently hung, the device seems to be getting an IP on the network.
[2024-07-05T15:27:14.554359] UG137FY4U: So I can see it on the network, but the `root` and `guest` users aren't allowed password auth via SSH.
[2024-07-05T15:34:05.545349] U04MTUF83QX: last I tried, I could ssh in
[2024-07-05T15:51:03.654459] UG137FY4U: Alright, I was able to hack the downloaded image to enable password auth and root login for ssh, but it seems like this should be the default for a pre-built image.

[2024-07-09T15:09:12.074389] U028G091SNM: Is there any capacity to add another RideSX4 board to the TestingFarm CKI pool? ---- related to <https://issues.redhat.com/browse/VROOM-20034|VROOM-20034>
[2024-07-09T18:02:50.355109] U04PQB5SV41: <@U02F2L89YTS> I ran into this issue today and am not sure how to proceed just yet with debugging it.  See <https://issues.redhat.com/browse/VROOM-19327> for some context. Comments on the ticket from today only. Basically when I build the image expected arm64 functionality is present but the atc built kernel does not contain it. That ticket is to verify that the functionality does not change between releases. Thanks!
[2024-07-10T09:29:49.583789] U02DXVBD5CP: Hi team, can anybody help moderating the retrospective meeting for today? I can't join because I have training at the same time. Thanks :smile_meow:
[2024-07-10T16:54:23.734669] U04N2DV1W3Y: Hi does anyone know why we don't have console log support, is there some ticket tracking this work,  it's supported already in Testing Farm.
[2024-07-10T17:18:54.802709] U04N2DV1W3Y: Another question maybe for <@U04QNH25QA1> where and how are we setting the Polarion test run assignee ? Are you using a static list or fetching from our packages/all repository ?
[2024-07-11T03:54:22.476859] U020YLADEKA: Hi team,
Woke up with a fever and a stomach bug , taking a sick day to recover.
[2024-07-11T15:56:48.358199] U04N0SVB92Q: Hi Folks, I am seeing a 502 Gateway error for Test-Console. Anyone else seeing it? <@U04QNH25QA1> can you please take a look?
[2024-07-11T17:24:31.377059] U02F2L89YTS: :rolled_up_newspaper:  *RHIVOS compose is now based on RHEL 9.5* :rolled_up_newspaper:

After a program decision, the current RHIVOS compose will be based on RHEL 9.5 in preparation for Tech preview. *It starts with the next nightly*.
Shortly the RHIVOS pipeline will support parallel versions and we'll have one for DevPreview UPdates (RHEL 9.4) and Tech preview (RHEL 9.5).

Source: <https://source.redhat.com/groups/public/autotoolchain/news>

More info in the email `Current RHIVOS builds moved to RHEL9.5` at the automotive-devel mailing list.
[2024-07-11T17:59:54.712029] U03DM1LN4UW: Hoping someone can clarify something for me - I see both "rhivos-1.0.0-candidate" and "rhivos-1.0.0" in Brew tags. what is the difference?
[2024-07-11T18:24:25.955389] U04MTUF83QX: -1.0.0 is a target tag
[2024-07-11T18:24:39.723739] U04MTUF83QX: -candidate is where builds land once you built them against that target
[2024-07-11T23:34:11.350219] U04JRTQ4LHK: <@U04NNGY4QQ2> Here's something for you for tomorrow morning: <https://issues.redhat.com/browse/VROOM-21437> - I believe there's some undesired package builds in rhivos-1.0.0-candidate that should be cleaned up.
[2024-07-15T10:00:03.806519] Unknown: Hi folks! The weekly ATC team meeting is coming up tomorrow. If you’ve already got topics, please add them to the agenda! Thanks!

[2024-07-15T12:56:58.508959] UNMGRQNRZ: As CentOS Stream 10 is now hitting the mirrors at <https://mirror.stream.centos.org/> is it possible to enable ODCS compose for AutoSD 10 on <https://autosd.sig.centos.org/> as well? It would help getting ready with Automotive SIG there. Is this already planned somewhere in Jira? couldn't find it.
[2024-07-16T12:00:05.398979] Unknown: Hey folks, please add your weekly status to <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JfTu9mH89aWYbuj3ApID3ADZYQB5P1P5lU-XGAx2GN0/edit#heading=h.g1reuk3pp72h|this document>. Thanks a lot!

[2024-07-16T18:09:07.843119] U04MTUF83QX: 3 times I run `wget <https://autosd.sig.centos.org/AutoSD-9/nightly/sample-images/auto-osbuild-qemu-autosd9-developer-regular-x86_64-1374921864.017a82ff.qcow2.xz>` 3 times it stops at 71%
[2024-07-16T18:09:12.735219] U04MTUF83QX: something's up with the server?
[2024-07-16T18:41:45.176639] U04JRTQ4LHK: Hey, does anyone recognise these addresses? Hopefully it's not us, as these VMs are spamming Polarion with requests and causing instabilities.
[2024-07-16T19:29:26.656159] U04NHMNPD32: Hi, it seems like it would help at different levels to have a "latest" link in the nightly images exposed on <https://autosd.sig.centos.org/AutoSD-9/>.
For example: <https://autosd.sig.centos.org/AutoSD-9/nightly/sample-images/>
• https://autosd.sig.centos.org/AutoSD-9/nightly/sample-images/auto-osbuild-qemu-autosd9-developer-ostree-aarch64-latest.qcow2.xz -> <https://autosd.sig.centos.org/AutoSD-9/nightly/sample-images/auto-osbuild-qemu-autosd9-developer-ostree-aarch64-1374921864.017a82ff.qcow2.xz>
• <https://autosd.sig.centos.org/AutoSD-9/nightly/sample-images/auto-osbuild-qemu-autosd9-developer-ostree-x86_64-1374921864.017a82ff.qcow2.xz>
• https://autosd.sig.centos.org/AutoSD-9/nightly/sample-images/auto-osbuild-qemu-autosd9-developer-ostree-x86_64-latest.qcow2.xz -> <https://autosd.sig.centos.org/AutoSD-9/nightly/sample-images/auto-osbuild-qemu-autosd9-developer-ostree-x86_64-1374921864.017a82ff.qcow2.xz>
• <and similar for other image types>
For example, some documentations parses the page and use the listing order to find the latest name. That isn't nice to read and it has various caveats handled more or less completely (e.g, listing order reliability)

Would that be something the toolchain team would be able to do?
[2024-07-16T20:23:12.471879] U04JD5EV3MJ: Folks, do you know if we need to include kernel-automotive again in this new rhivos tag inheritance? Today, I got this error in brew:
```BuildError: package kernel-automotive not in list for tag rhivos-1.0.0-gate```
[2024-07-17T07:09:28.477759] U04MTUF83QX: <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29459885/does-amazon-s3-support-symlinks> seems to say the simplest is to indeed do the redirect at the web proxy frontend (but we shouldn't do 301 as otherwise browser are going to be confused)
[2024-07-17T15:46:08.208399] U03DM1LN4UW: Who do I talk to about updates to the release checklist?
[2024-07-17T16:37:18.249509] UG137FY4U: Anyone have a quick set of instructions for updating the kernel for AutoSD on a Raspberry Pi? I have the updated RPMs installed, but I believe I also need to update the Pi firmware with the changes... ?
[2024-07-17T20:27:49.272929] UG137FY4U: I solved that ^^ eventually with some grub-fu
[2024-07-18T10:49:01.902599] U0171SJF00H: :howdy:   <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1R_aV8STUFzJbCiHhO7UK7nA3FUy_rM-AC0yPIyY2ZDY/edit?usp=sharing>  kind reminder to add any issues you'd like to discuss during today's backlog refinement, thank :bows:
[2024-07-18T13:07:43.705919] U028G091SNM: what is the backround for these tests:

[2024-07-18T21:06:09.627119] U03DM1LN4UW: Hey Folks! <@U04QH469ETF> will be the ProdSec Supply Chain consultant that will allocated to assist a bit. I'll let him provide a little clarification on his role as it gets defined.
[2024-07-18T21:09:23.099589] U04QH469ETF: Hello! So I'm still kind of figuring it out (I was just assigned to the role), but I will be acting as a consultant for RHIVOS' pipeline from Product Security, specifically around onboarding it into Konflux, when the time comes. Right now I'm in onboarding mode, trying to learn as much as I can around RHIVOS' pipeline, so I welcome any resources or recommendations on meetings to attend.

I worked as the security architect for RHIVOS for the past 3 years, so the product isn't new to me, just the pipeline portion.

[2024-07-22T14:35:01.067869] U04AXB4GK52: Hi everyone, I noticed emails to automotive-a-team this morning w.r.t. <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/certification-assembly/-/merge_requests/150|this merge request> and after visiting the MR I noticed <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/certification-assembly/-/merge_requests/150#note_11817871|this merge request review comment> from our bot account that looks like a human wrote it. Did we introduce some code review AI or is someone logged in to Gitlab as the bot account?
[2024-07-22T14:38:14.882669] U04JRTQ4LHK: <@U04AXB4GK52> I believe the bot has gained sentience. I am not sure how, or why, but it may relate to lightning strikes. I think we need to look into this because the quality of code review shows significant capability and we may have now a new technology to compete with CoPilot.
[2024-07-22T14:39:11.492309] U04AXB4GK52: If it is new AI then that's pretty neat, but if it is someone logged in as the bot account please log out and log back in as yourself.

<@U0171SJF00H> <@U02DXVBD5CP> We should probably consider stripping people's permissions to log in to this account and rotate any tokens.
[2024-07-22T14:40:24.505049] U02DXVBD5CP: I can vote we restrict view to the bot authentication
[2024-07-22T14:49:39.034939] U0171SJF00H: One of us should expect a time travelling cyborg showing up at our doors soon, stopping one of us creating that account in the first place
[2024-07-22T15:06:19.953769] U0171SJF00H: For real though.. Whoever this is, please log out. We shouldn't be using accounts dedicated for automation for our own use, we share those credentials through bitwarden in good faith that they won't be abused (either intentionally or not)
[2024-07-23T11:57:30.639479] UJJV82KRP: Hi
I have logged in to bot account more than a week ago to give it credentials to CA repo by creating a new token for it with all required permissions on CA.
This was done in order to push auto MRs to the CA repo
It might be that while being logged in to bot account for the token creation I approved by mistake an MR
Sorry for the confusion , AI is not so clever yet ...

<https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/services/test-console/-/jobs/24471125>
Thanks in advance
[2024-07-26T15:38:35.608569] U01TXCW3RMF: Hey everyone, could we have the file names not truncate for the RHIVOS image server? Example: <https://rhivos.auto-toolchain.redhat.com/in-vehicle-os-9/ER6-rc1/sample-images/>. Makes it hard to easily just pick the file I want

[2024-07-30T17:53:34.127419] U03DM1LN4UW: Is there some place where I could see the list of packages that are new/different from RHEL?
[2024-07-30T18:06:59.647729] U0205F28UMN: Do you mean in base RHIVOS or in the additional repositories which supplement RHIVOS? The main differences I know between RHEL and RHIVOS are a couple of packages:
1. kernel-automotive (RT kernel + compilation options found useful - a lot of modules we dont want)
2. the gcc and binutils cross compilers which are built in the RHEL build system out of gcc but only shipped in RHIVOS
In the centos-automotive sig and copr I see about 50 packages which are extras but I don't know which ones are 'would like to have in autosd someday' and which are 'this is meant to help us but we dont like it'
[2024-07-30T18:11:48.868499] U03DM1LN4UW: base RHIVOS, although I'm interested to hear about the supplemental since that sounds new to me
[2024-07-30T18:51:58.447039] U04MTUF83QX: <@U0205F28UMN> the cross compilers aren't shipped in RHIVOS :slightly_smiling_face:

[2024-08-01T19:07:44.054829] U02F2L89YTS: *Package Level Pipelines Outage  (Resolved)*
_July 1th, 2024_
A recent change at the the RHIVOS pipeline, the Package Level Pipeline started to fail for test against the nightly. This affected also Test Console, as TC uses the Package Level Pipeline for running the tests.
There were two bug and the fixes has been already merged. Everything should be back to normal.

*But*, we're experiencing some issues with the Ridesx4 boards. There seems to be some problem with the provisioning. We're investigating it.
Maybe it's a temporary infra issue.
[2024-08-02T12:42:26.982719] U04Q4USRZTM: Hi team,
I need a look at <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/infrastructure/-/merge_requests/317>

As part of the effort to choose the right dashboard framework for RHIVOS I was exploring 3 different frameworks this sprint : Dash, Streamlit and React
You can find documentation <https://docs.google.com/document/d/113LqsrAyk7fLNNpMtiwXnU0rSQRyIRxR6OsdMn_p-pE/edit#heading=h.tz8kl9jphqh9|here>  (in work, still needs some specific RHIVOS requirements from Steve and insights from Michael regarding his dashboard work)
My work is described in the document above and will be demonstrated as part of tomorrow Demo meeting
I will schedule a meeting with Steve and others regarding our RHIVOS specific requirements from a dashboard
You are invited to read the document before the demo meeting, we will not have enough time to go over it all but I will try to cover important points during the demo
If you want to play with the demo applications you can clone my repo from <https://github.com/emesika/dashboard_frameworks|here>

_Aug 8th, 2024_
Last nightly failed to boot during the smoke-tests in the pipeline. We tested locally and the image is not booting. We're trying to find the issue.
As the tests failed, the image was not promoted. This means that the *current nightly is the previous one* and *it works*.

More updates here: <https://source.redhat.com/groups/public/autotoolchain/news>
[2024-08-08T20:05:16.741839] U0205F28UMN: As of `Thu  8 Aug 19:56:22 UTC 2024` I can't build an image from sample-images due to a package mismatch. I get:

_Aug 13th, 2024_
The *kernel-automotive-5.14.0-486.436.el9iv* was the last one able to boot due to this issue <https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-45533|RHEL-45533>. The ticket is complex and is currently being worked on, but in the meantime we have tagged back that kernel version so that the pipeline and the nightly were unblocked.
This means that *we have a new nightly today*, but *it does not contain the latest kernel version*, but the previously mentioned one.

Last night *AutoSD* hit the same issue, so we missed last nightly upstream. We'll pin the kernel version until the bug get fixed, so we can build the nightly again.

[2024-08-13T13:50:30.457779] U03DM1LN4UW: Hi folks! Can someone confirm for how many helm charts we are shipping in the repo?
[2024-08-13T15:35:14.353659] U02DXVBD5CP: Hi <@U03DM1LN4UW>
yesterday I tried to push RHIVOS's compose to cdn-stage and hit the error w.r.t `unsigned rpms` so I went back to check your doc <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1B7rnM1cIbG_tCBn5GDhUuw-nnbuOaxJKjeS1dLZLYLI/edit> and realized that you have listed there that RHIVOS should request its own `signing key`. This is really helpful and good to know early as I have been working on RHEL key
My plan is to start looking into this signing process. Maybe in the following weeks, I can reach out to you? Let me know, thanks!
[2024-08-14T14:14:13.239229] U04JRTQ4LHK: <@UJJV82KRP> I can't make the dashboard call tonight (something popped up and because it's so far outside my normal working hours..). Can you please record it for me? Meanwhile I put my expectations+notes about my current poc into your dashboard doc.

[2024-08-14T15:05:03.631249] U04N9LTR47M: Thanks Eli, can't make it either, I'll watch the recording, but it's an exciting meeting to discuss the build of a dashboard for greater visibility to validator results and traceability- looking forward to it
[2024-08-14T16:32:20.350699] U011CBYSALV: <@U020YLADEKA> unrelated to S4 really, but when I'm looking at the rpm list, there are still few other rpms that we pull in from upstream into RHIVOS builds. Through <https://gitlab.com/redhat/edge/ci-cd/pipe-x/custom-images/-/blob/main/qa.mpp.yml?ref_type=heads#L36|here>
it's not a good practice to just enable EPEL fro downstream builds. While we won't be releasing the "qa" image to customers and it's just for internal use, I do not think we can guarantee the actual tested content is released in RHIVOS. We should actually validate and fail when we include anything from upstream - or even better,  run the build disconnected only with the compose repos
[2024-08-14T16:32:25.276359] U011CBYSALV: <@U02F2L89YTS> wdyt?
[2024-08-14T20:16:39.774019] U04PQB5SV41: Hi team, not sure if this is the right place. I ran a test through test console earlier today. everything passed for the tests but there was an upload to s3 error in the pipeline which blocked it being exported to polarion. Here is the s3 upload error.
<https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/package-level-pipelines/-/jobs/25253895>
The test results <https://artifacts.osci.redhat.com/testing-farm/8b724068-09ba-4da4-9cbd-bf60f4602611/>
Question, Can I still salvage this run and get the results loaded to polarion? This is needed for MM foa activities? Or do I need to rerun the plan again once we can resolve what this issue is? thanks.
[2024-08-16T16:37:53.931679] U018G4EKMSA: Question related to unified image,
I see this MR

Which made qm broken,
I see that the following parameters in manifest were removed
<https://gitlab.com/redhat/edge/ci-cd/pipe-x/custom-images/-/merge_requests/30/diffs#4d7d29ae8cee663a8050d8b4fd41f02bf88336f8_15_0>

Are not included,
What is the plan ? currently there is in nightly qm-ostree images which have the following reference
● auto-sig:rhivos9/x86_64/qemu-qa

which is broken, qm_rootfs is not created properly

<@U02F2L89YTS> <@U020YLADEKA>
[2024-08-18T08:10:15.805429] U020YLADEKA: Hi <@U018G4EKMSA> ,

Yariv, When you say *'*made qm broken' can you elaborate on what exactly is broken currently and what/who does it impacts?

*About broader context:*
Juanje will know more as he was more involved but I'll try to provide some context and the plan as described in this ticket <https://issues.redhat.com/browse/VROOM-21951> which is an outcome of the meeting notes <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DmftAiDZkjgca4hQU4Cx1PmZZJwJC5Cm8-OxmpSGdsg/edit#heading=h.h2occ8sm00w9|here>(Checkout the outcomes section) with Juanje, Amanda, Mathew and Rachel.

• Outcome section: 
    ◦ We should be testing on an image that is the core RPMs plus the test framework, including the QM Partition. We should test against a ‘regular’ image (not ostree).
        ▪︎ We think the QM image may already meet this criteria but is ostree
        ▪︎ If possible we want to use this in the practice CTC later this week
        ▪︎ Once we confirm our image - we should rename it :slightly_smiling_face:
    ◦ We should have a validator / test that confirms this is the case.
        ▪︎ <https://issues.redhat.com/browse/VROOM-21952>
    ◦ There may be some tests that require a custom image setup. This can be handled on a case-by-case basis.
    ◦ <mailto:juanje@redhat.com|Juanje Ojeda> will own updating the QA image.
        ▪︎ <https://issues.redhat.com/browse/VROOM-21951>
[2024-08-18T08:13:36.737019] U020YLADEKA: Yariv, if you can open a ticket about this issue with all the details that will be great.
Juanje/Ozan will take a look tomorrow when they're back to work.
[2024-08-18T14:42:55.772889] U018G4EKMSA: Thanks Avihai
I will describe the issue, in a ticket

[2024-08-21T13:17:52.377269] U020YLADEKA: <@U04QNH25QA1> <@U02JHD5HMGC> maybe related to the Ride4 issues we see right now.

This is what I get from the dashboard:
It seems that out of the x6 Ride4 boards we somehow have 3 borrowed boards and 2 disabled ones. not sure why.
[2024-08-21T13:19:25.783389] U02JHD5HMGC: ride4-15 has been disabled for approx 2 weeks.  Manual install did not work there, but no further investigation.
Second disabled board I think is recent, as I hadn't seen it on my dashboard.
[2024-08-21T13:19:54.070899] U02JHD5HMGC: An alert for when a board is disabled is something to add to backlog.
[2024-08-21T14:27:10.155009] U04JRTQ4LHK: <@U020YLADEKA> so is the issue related to capacity? or something wrong with the boards our test happened to pick? (We're also not sure if it's the tests themselves)
[2024-08-21T15:09:40.530659] U020YLADEKA: Not sure <@U04JRTQ4LHK>, I'll let <@U04QNH25QA1> and <@U02JHD5HMGC> investigate and know more to answer about it.
We did have more usage due to the new Mixed Criticality release we issued today so that might explain it .
[2024-08-21T15:47:52.119529] U02JHD5HMGC: I don’t believe capacity is an issue but with boards becoming disabled I’d expect more problems. Some tests run longer than others. There are timings in test console .ctc file. 
I was suggesting borrowing boards to get us back to normal operational capacity of 6 boards while I troubleshoot shoot the 2 disabled boards.  
I will need a short 10 minute window to do that on Thursday morning.

Probably due to upgrade over the weekend as it did not run at all, and the upstream autoSD is available.

[2024-08-26T16:18:46.436159] U04AXB4GK52: W.r.t. the Mixed Criticality build, it seems like the name/version string has deviated from the style of previous releases, is there a reason for this?

For example, based on what was done for dev preview and tech preview I would have expected this to be `RHIVOS-1.0-MixedCriticality` rather than `Mixed_Criticality`

I ask because the nvr I saw with  today's nightly was not

This means we have 5 working boards in the pool.
I will create a spike ticket for this as it is likely to impact mixed criticality testing.
At least the last image, and the test logs should be on ride4-16 for some analysis.

```A short time ago , in a lab far, far away,
there were several Renesas development boards used for test
software in an automovice context ```
Cool content explaining it end to end with usage statistics demonstrating how important this integration work really is(~130 jobs per day for MC Ride4 !!)  :tip_hat_thankee:

[2024-09-26T14:18:12.243839] U04CLM07JNA: <!channel> Anyone see any value in Zuul CI : <https://medium.com/volvo-cars-engineering/openinfra-summit-berlin-2022-3c2e52dbbf22>  ? cc: <@URH2PJUCV>
[2024-09-26T14:27:52.478079] U04MTUF83QX: <@U04CLM07JNA> we used to run it in OSCI for RHEL and I think we still do for Fedora, but the RHEL instance is being replaced by gitlab ci basically
[2024-09-26T14:28:41.103689] U04MTUF83QX: Zuul CI has been developed back the days for OpenStack iirc. One feature that it had that is really interesting is the ability to run tests involving multiple PR/MR across different projects
[2024-09-26T17:14:58.849419] U011CBYSALV: i've never heard of anyone using zuul and not regretting it;)
[2024-09-26T19:16:56.235759] U04Q4USRZTM: Zuul is currently used in the glibc pipeline here an example: <https://centos.softwarefactory-project.io/zuul/t/centos/build/667e4864f78e438487459cfd174b844d/artifacts>
Here also an example of MR that trigger it <https://gitlab.com/redhat/centos-stream/rpms/glibc/-/merge_requests/196>
[2024-09-26T19:19:26.972889] U04Q4USRZTM: <!channel> we'd like to trigger CTC against Renesas rcar_s4 boards with RHIVOS-1.0-TechPreview.
I know that image is the same of the latest but we need it to have things in order in Polarion.
To be able to trigger a plan we need a configuration file, see the error: <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/package-level-pipelines/-/pipelines/9670435>
Could we add it? thanks
[2024-09-27T11:25:03.500719] U011CBYSALV: I asked in <https://issues.redhat.com/browse/VROOM-19026|VROOM-19026>, but let me ask here as well, <@U04NNGY4QQ2>
I must say I stumbled upon the convoluted parsing and substitutions of AMI file in TC ....it's quite horrible indeed.
I wonder why it needs to be complicated.
What's wrong with a directory structure? Why do we need a file at all? just use a date and sequence for multiple runs within a day and it's perfect (e.g. like RHEL's RHEL-8.6.0-20240815.4) and that's it. Who needs anything else really?

[2024-10-03T15:31:14.632349] U04NHTDFS6P: My apologies for missing the sprint planning meeting today. I had a personal emergency that I needed to handle. I'm back in case anyone needs to talk to me about anything.
[2024-10-03T15:49:06.716179] U01B16R8TNC: hello, apparently <https://rhivos.auto-toolchain.redhat.com/> is not reachable anymore
[2024-10-03T16:48:22.696649] U02DXVBD5CP: Hi all, sorry about the webserver instability. It has received a lot of requests these days. Also there seems to be some kind of web crawler looking at this error log:

I'm going to set up `robots.txt` soonish
[2024-10-03T16:49:37.850689] U02DXVBD5CP: In any case, we have a keepalive.service which will restart the container when it's not reacheable. So if you can't reach a webserver, give a few second or minute until it is back
[2024-10-03T16:54:32.789379] U0171SJF00H: <@U04JRTQ4LHK> noticed this before, We saw some chatGPT headers :sweat_smile:
[2024-10-03T17:15:27.935439] U0205F28UMN: I am guessing a LOT of AI is crawling the server.. set up robots.txt and then if htis is apache:
# Spiders-gone-wild
# These spiders may not follow robots.txt and will
# hit admin sections which consume large amounts of CPU
RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} ^.*(Bytespider|ClaudeBot|Amazonbot|YandexBot|ChatGLM-Spider|GPTBot|Barkrowler|YisouSpider|MJ12bot).*$ [NC]
RewriteRule .* - [F,L]
[2024-10-03T17:15:52.716869] U0205F28UMN: Many of the bots don't always follow robots.txt
[2024-10-04T07:49:10.116779] U02DXVBD5CP: just wonder how can it reaches internal network
[2024-10-04T08:50:47.719379] U04JRTQ4LHK: I saw previously chatgpt bots scanning <http://autosd.sig.centos.org|autosd.sig.centos.org> but not the internal web server?
[2024-10-04T08:50:55.363589] U04JRTQ4LHK: So that's new
[2024-10-04T08:52:14.095529] U04JRTQ4LHK: That client looks like an internal client (10.0.2.100). Might even just be security team doing internal network scans.
[2024-10-04T09:20:41.074549] U0205F28UMN: 10.0.2.100 is the up address we use in the build for the internal web server when you use rpm ostree commands 
[2024-10-04T09:21:16.178519] U0205F28UMN: Ah autocorrect we meet again 
[2024-10-04T11:20:36.892859] U0205F28UMN: Is it possible for me to see what the logs are? There is an internal 10.0.2.100 but I think it is a switch so if it is trying to connect then there are other problems
[2024-10-04T11:27:21.987419] U0205F28UMN: And my apologies.. I missed that the problem requests were to the internal server versus the autosd one. If it is the internal one there should be no ai bots but if there is you need to open a security ticket
[2024-10-04T12:59:50.661229] U0205F28UMN: Hey there seems to be something odd with <https://autosd.sig.centos.org/AutoSD-9/nightly/repos/AutoSD/compose/AutoSD/x86_64/os/repodata/repomd.xml> It refers to repodata/638e860f370ecaa54396b8262190eefd3bdd2255b845227b8e2fc87964365f79-primary.xml.zst
which isnt' there and instead there is a file with a different timestamp from 5 hours later with a different name
[2024-10-04T13:00:20.630339] U0205F28UMN: did something happen at 09:05 UTC to change whatever was done at 04:22?

[2024-10-07T11:04:52.871039] UKSDRN92R: Hello! I am testing glibc on rhel and I am wondering what is the relation between rhivos images and rhel distros  used to build them. How often are those images build and do you use latest rhel nightly to build rhivos images? Is there a way I can check what rhel image was used to build rhivos. Thanks!

[2024-10-08T16:58:33.706859] UG137FY4U: We generally run a PCP container to collect host system metrics under load. In a "default" (Fedora specifically here) podman config, this works fine because the container by default has access to the host kernel file systems, and we run with host networking as well. I'm getting the impression on newer runs on RHIVOS/AutoSD that our PCP container does not in fact have access to the host system metrics. Anyone know if we are explicitly isolating namespaces in this way with the podman config?

Also the flasherd service was not sending output to Loki, and was in a bad state, so I restarted flasherd.
I will cancel the dpac Renesas smoke test, nothing useful will happen with that.  Will allow the images to be published.

I hope you enjoyed the long weekend for those on public holiday yesterday :sunglasses:

ATC weekly team meeting time moved +1 hour for this week only as it conflicted with program call most likely due to day light savings changes in Europe (Oct27)but not in US yet (Nov3).

Another kind ask:
Focus area leads to please add your ATC weekly updates to the ATC sum up doc so we can be more prepared to share them on the program call (usually this ask is done in the weekly meeting followed by the program call but this week the order is reversed:))

&gt; Red Hat IT will conduct *<https://groups.google.com/a/redhat.com/g/outage-list/c/_RDnxHtdblA|IAD2 resiliency testing>* between *Dec 2nd and Dec 6th, 2024*.
&gt; 
&gt; As part of this outage, on *December 6th, Friday from 07:30 AM EDT until 2:00 PM EDT*, a number of major SP services will be brought down and then back up during the mentioned maintenance window.
&gt; 
&gt; *What SP services are impacted?*
&gt; All major SP services are impacted:
&gt; • brew-builders
&gt; • brew-services ( hub,web,util,db)
&gt; • dist-git
&gt; • gitbz
&gt; • mbs
&gt; • odcs
&gt; • radas
&gt; • rcm-compose-shell-hosts
&gt; • rcm-shell
&gt; • spmm-util
&gt; • tps-server
&gt; 
&gt; See <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18rhdEIkmi-lamsTw_ohh_FU4hgXAzIEmUlT3h5rwtGQ/edit?gid=140664926#gid=140664926|SP ITUP Resiliency Test> for more details. 
&gt; 
&gt; *How will this affect you?*
&gt; The Red Hat IT team will be running ITUP specific tests from Monday until Friday where SP services are hosted. On the 6th Dec, SP services will be brought down and then back up. Some of your jobs may terminate with a failure, and you will have to restart them as if they failed due to an unplanned system outage. For any issues you notice through the week, feel free to reach out to SP. In case the issues are related to IT we will follow-up as necessary on the suggested <https://redhat-internal.slack.com/archives/C056JRK8LAJ|Slack channel>.
&gt; 
&gt; Bringing down the SP services will potentially affect the listed workflows:
&gt; • Composes <https://spaces.redhat.com/display/catalog/compose-workflow>
&gt; • Container Builds <https://spaces.redhat.com/display/catalog/container-build-workflow>
&gt; • Container Push Post Processing <https://spaces.redhat.com/display/catalog/container-push-post-processing-workflow>
&gt; • CPaaS Builds <https://spaces.redhat.com/display/catalog/cpaas-build-workflow>
&gt; • CPaaS Managed Services Releases <https://spaces.redhat.com/display/catalog/cpaas-managed-services-release-workflow>
&gt; • Flatpak Builds <https://spaces.redhat.com/display/catalog/flatpak-build-workflow>
&gt; • Mead Builds <https://spaces.redhat.com/display/catalog/mead-build-workflow>
&gt; • Module Builds <https://spaces.redhat.com/display/catalog/module-build-workflow>
&gt; • ODCS Composes <https://spaces.redhat.com/display/catalog/odcs-compose-workflow>
&gt; • OSCI Composes <https://spaces.redhat.com/display/catalog/osci-compose-workflow>
&gt; • Package Requests <https://spaces.redhat.com/display/catalog/package-request-workflow>
&gt; • PNC Builds <https://spaces.redhat.com/display/catalog/pnc-build-workflow>
&gt; • RPM Builds <https://spaces.redhat.com/display/catalog/rpm-build-workflow>
&gt; • RPM Releases <https://spaces.redhat.com/display/catalog/rpm-release-workflow>
&gt;     ◦ rpm - early auto-signing, after attaching to an advisory
&gt;     ◦ rpm - normal auto-signing, after advisory moves to QE
&gt; • Source Containers <https://spaces.redhat.com/display/catalog/source-container-workflow>
&gt; 
&gt; I hope this heads-up will help you plan your activities accordingly. If you have any questions or concerns, reach out to us on <https://app.slack.com/client/E030G10V24F/C07GVPCLZU3|#team-sp-rhel>.
Sounds like we could be affected by this on multiple fronts
[2024-11-18T15:06:07.444589] U011CBYSALV: <@U020YLADEKA> <@U02F2L89YTS> so what's the intention with the separate var? AFAICT it doesn't work on S4 (I checked current nightly), you have to change the kernel cmdline accordingly (or revert, or some other fix)
[2024-11-18T17:31:14.834489] U04PQB5SV41: Hi Team, any idea why some pipelines look for a file that does not exist? What triggers this check? I have tried this 3 times today with the same error while running other jobs which go through without an issue? This is through test console.

[2024-11-19T13:57:57.583339] U028G091SNM: Hi, I seam to be having a repo issue on AutoSD image from nightly?
```error: Updating rpm-md repo 'autosd': cannot update repo 'autosd': Yum repo downloading error: Downloading error(s): repodata/0d7a2d915314cb9fe60100d675e2783f1cb1ad577f5f47129685c1cbed157b8f-primary.xml.zst - Cannot download, all mirrors were already tried without success; Last error: Status code: 404 for <https://autosd.sig.centos.org/AutoSD-9/nightly/repos/AutoSD/compose/AutoSD/aarch64/os/repodata/0d7a2d915314cb9fe60100d675e2783f1cb1ad577f5f47129685c1cbed157b8f-primary.xml.zst> (IP: 35.168.68.246)```
[2024-11-19T15:57:28.930249] U04MXBN4WRZ: How often the qa builds in <https://rhivos.auto-toolchain.redhat.com/in-vehicle-os-9/RHIVOS-1/latest-RHIVOS-1/Renesas/> are triggered? I see latest is from 2024-Nov-16 03:20, there is a chance to get a new build anytime soon?
[2024-11-19T17:36:28.759769] U0205F28UMN: Is there something still wrong with the pipeline? The files in <https://autosd.sig.centos.org/AutoSD-9/autosd9-202411191402/repos/AutoSD/compose/AutoSD/x86_64/os/repodata/> (latest compose triggered by <@U04NNGY4QQ2> earlier) and <https://autosd.sig.centos.org/AutoSD-9/nightly/repos/AutoSD/compose/AutoSD/x86_64/os/repodata/> (which is what automotive-image-builder is going to try and use). Some of the files seem to be the same 'names' but others are not.
[2024-11-19T18:23:49.495229] U011CBYSALV: <@UG0N57XEX> could you please take a look tomorrow morning if <@U04N2DV1W3Y>doesn't have any magic answers today?  It is really *concerning* that people do not really test things before making impactful changes. It really does affect a lot of people right now

AFAICT the S4 images from ATC will still *not* work as of today/tomorrow. The autoinit partition correction has not been merged (MR135 on a-i-b. today there was "only" a fix for broken qemu target)
[2024-11-19T18:33:28.965349] U011CBYSALV: is there still anybody from ATC around? I really wonder...if we want to have some S4 image working tomorrow....I mean..to me, AFAICT, the easiest change would be to revert the separate /var again.
[2024-11-19T18:35:49.000299] U011CBYSALV: ...because the alternative is that somebody merges Ed's MR (which would be obsoleted by alex's work from today), bumps sample images, and then anyway we'll have a lot smaller /var that likely wont' be sufficient for kernel(at least) so it's not really going to be the end of these fixes.
[2024-11-19T18:59:17.469449] U020YLADEKA: <@U02F2L89YTS> <@U04NNGY4QQ2> can you please revert the /var again and make the S4 latest image bootable once more as <@U011CBYSALV> suggests above? 
[2024-11-19T19:01:32.377229] U011CBYSALV: i don't know when the pipeline gets triggered TBH, but i'm fairly sure without that MR we're still in the same state as yesterday. i mean...i don't know how desperate rachel is to kick of ctc...
[2024-11-19T19:13:00.621459] U02F2L89YTS: The downstream (rhivos) pipeline is broken right now. Too many different issues between yesterday and today :confused:
We've been fixing stuff, but still we couldn't get last night pipeline to finish the builds :confused:
Also, most of the ATC team is already gone, so no ppl around for approving MRs. So, I don't thing we can do that revert now.
I'm not even sure we need to. I still see too many contradictory opinions around that topic.
I'll wait to see what we decide tomorrow on the readiness meeting. We still need to wait for the exception about bluechi before rebuilding the release.
[2024-11-19T19:16:41.501739] U011CBYSALV: which pushes any possible runs for ctc to thursday
[2024-11-19T19:18:21.062019] U011CBYSALV: i hope at least aws started to work again
[2024-11-19T19:20:05.633549] U01KBN9MFB7: <@U011CBYSALV>, can you summarize your recommendation?  Are you suggesting we need to both revert the /var change and wait for Ed's MR?  I know we are just trying to get a build working for CTC, but randomly making changes after Dev Freeze is not helping us.  We have a blocker/exception process that we should be leveraging to have cross-functional discussions about the changes that need to happen to the build.  It sounds like discussion is needed if there are contradictory opinions.  Let's have a daily meeting, if needed.  With conversations happening in so many channels, it is hard to keep up.
[2024-11-19T19:23:35.418299] U01KBN9MFB7: With regard to the exception for bluechi, I'd argue that this is something that could wait if it slows us down in getting a working build for CTC.
[2024-11-19T19:56:03.380069] U028G091SNM: Team, I've updated the CKI pipelines to use the new test_images_info.json file - we should be good to remove the config file from being built in the pipelines
cc: <@U02F2L89YTS>
[2024-11-19T20:59:05.347299] U04PQB5SV41: Hi team, did we also change the latest builds to be read only on `/usr` ? I installed RHIVOS-1.0-TechPreview-202411041507 and after running tmt I see the following error:
       `mv: cannot remove '/usr/lib/systemd/coredump.conf.d/10-automotive.conf': Read-only file system`
Some tests rely on this being updated or temporarily removed because it blocks the creation of core dumps. Is there a build key to turn this off? Is it only on the qa images or also on the developer images?
This was a ridesx4 image that i used.
[2024-11-20T13:24:27.147349] U020YLADEKA: Hi team,
I moved ATC MVP and ATC RHAS meetings(for my directs) from this week ahead as the team is in need for more focus time and less meetings.
Appologies for the short notice. :pray:
[2024-11-21T12:37:19.917169] U04AXB4GK52: <@U02F2L89YTS> et al: any reason <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/downstream-pipelines-as-code/-/merge_requests/417|this> can't be merged like release activities or otherwise? If not Im going to _push the button_
[2024-11-21T16:47:29.560079] U02F2L89YTS: FYI, I've just triggered the "nightly" pipeline, but without the ridesx4 smoke-tests. Something is happening with those boards and the jobs never end.
We have been having many different issues this week, so we couldn't build a fresh `latest` build for a few days. So, this we'll give us one.
Even if it doesn't smoke-test those ridesx4 images...
<https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/downstream-pipelines-as-code/-/pipelines/10089164>
[2024-11-21T17:15:56.785379] U02JHD5HMGC: I've opened a ticket with details that I discussed with Roni yesterday, showing a TC job that user cancelled, but gitlab pipeline ran.
The Ride4 board was borrowed for 3 days and the request had to be manually cancelled.  This may go away when gitlab PLP is removed from workflow :crossed_fingers:

There was a gitlab runner timeout after 6 hours.  PreviouslyI had seen same TC status with a gitlab *job* timeout of 15 hours.
How can we get more detail on the runner timeout, and increase if needed?
I don't believe this happens often, I've only seen it once before in recent days.

[2024-11-27T18:05:37.948089] U028G091SNM: Just wanted to get thoughts an discuss shared pool usage of Rcar4 boards for on-boarding from CKI (as its been discussed in the past, due to the extremely difficult nature of the rcar flashing implementation) that there should only be one pool. Now that we are using tf-requests module, it would indeed make sense to consolidate resources allowing for a more simple and generalized implementation in CKI infra also.

The one issue I see is the expectation of no other triggering in "CTC" where CKI will still trigger against the pool.
Also I see no reason to not consolidate the ridesx4  cki resources to one shared pool also.

[2024-12-03T19:30:25.968139] U028B6GFVHV: Hi,
I am doing a performance assessment comparing the Ride4/TI/Renesas platforms for Tech Preview.   I wanted to point out that I am seeing a difference with the Ride4 Tech Preview platform only.   One of our benchmarks requires bluechi packages.   For all three platforms, it is necessary to install *bluechi-ctl and bluechi-selinux.*  But only on the Ride4 Tech Preview platform, I notice additionally *bluechi-agent* is not installed and had to be manually installed.
Thanks,
Matt
[2024-12-05T10:56:02.513549] U02JHD5HMGC: I have ATC dashboard MR for review - adding pass rate metric for upstream and downstream pipelines.  Saw 48% downstream and 91% upstream.  Finding the why of that is a task for a different day or sprint, but today it has crept up to 50% and 94% respectively.
To see the metrics, you'll need to view screenshots in the linked Jira ticket.

Please do not cancel the ATC weekly meeting.

[2024-12-11T13:29:17.938569] U01TXCW3RMF: Question, was there a new release strategy for RHIVOS images? I see TechPreview-Update is now gone and there are newer TechPreview builds. I was under the assumption TechPreview was done a while ago
[2024-12-11T14:04:03.699329] U04JPFBCSTB: That was DevPreview and DevPreviewUpdate
[2024-12-11T14:09:56.034539] U02F2L89YTS: Sorry, I need to send an email about this. I haven't had time yet :see_no_evil:
But yest, we removed the `TechPreview-Update`, which was a copy from `latest-RHIVOS-1`.
It was causing some confusion, so we remove them. I'll explain better in the email.
The changes in the `TechPreview` release are because we need to re-spin the release due some exceptions (updated version for BlueChi and the Automotive packages added to the compose).
We saved the previous TechPreview as RC1 and we're rebuilding it weekly, preparing for the final version on Dec 19, so we can use it for the FuSa Submission in Feb, but which tests starting in Jan.

[2024-12-12T12:30:47.008879] U04NNGY4QQ2: :announcement: Hi all!

To optimize time and resources, we are planning to remove unnecessary builds from the AutoToolchain product build pipeline.
I have compiled a <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WkUrT8S4h7orbv2ckwJVxKBsLWhOep42QeZXeq6z4n0/edit?usp=sharing|list> of all builds currently included in the pipeline. Items marked in red are proposed for removal, meaning the corresponding images will no longer be available.
Please review the list to confirm that the images marked for removal are not in use and ensure their exclusion will not impact your work. Your feedback is crucial in finalizing these changes.
Thank you for your cooperation!
[2024-12-12T12:41:27.153409] U011CBYSALV: <@U04NNGY4QQ2> I don't understand the upstream/downstream distinction there. Can you explain?
[2024-12-12T14:05:33.091339] U02F2L89YTS: :announcement:  We have a small change coming in the image names.
For historic reasons, we have `rhivos9` in the image file name: `auto-osbuild-qemu-rhivos9-qm-minimal-ostree-aarch64-10238830.9e7b0910`
But that `9` (originally a reference to rhel9 as a base for the release) is wrong and confusing.
We're going to remove that release number, to avoid confusions.
We can still see the distro it's based on at the <https://rhivos.auto-toolchain.redhat.com/in-vehicle-os-9/RHIVOS-1/latest-RHIVOS-1/info.txt|info.txt> file:
```Upstream distro: rhel-9.6```
And inside the image and the `/etc/os-release` inside the image still shows the RHEL version.
This change shouldn't break anything as now the expected way for getting the images name is the new <https://rhivos.auto-toolchain.redhat.com/in-vehicle-os-9/RHIVOS-1/latest-RHIVOS-1/test_images_info.json|test_images_info.json> file.

[2025-01-13T08:00:21.111309] U020YLADEKA: Hi <!channel>, :tada::sparkles: Celebrating *Five Years of Hubert Magic!* :sparkles::tada:
Let’s fire up the celebration engine because today we’re marking _five incredible years_ of brilliance, dedication, and just downright awesomeness from the one and only *Hubert*! :partying_face:
It all started on January 13, 2020, when Hubert joined Red Hat as a bright-eyed intern in Cloud Services—and let me tell you, he didn’t just "join"; he _blasted off_! :rocket: Fast-forward a mere 1.5 years, and he was already a core part of the RHIVOS family and the ToolChain team, where the real magic began. :dizzy:

*Now, five years in, the highlights are almost too many to count* (but I'll try):
:sparkles: Nearly finishing a master’s degree in Enterprise Software Systems (with a dissertation tackling QNX agents for BlueChi like a boss).
:sparkles: Launching a side business _developing platforms_ (because why not conquer the world, right?).
:sparkles: Crushing it as a Senior Software Engineer with major contributions to RHIVOS infra and gating—as a leader, designer, mentor, and all-around rockstar.
:sparkles: Driving collaboration across products and teams like a pro.
:sparkles: Oh, and just casually filing multiple patents because innovation runs through his veins.

Hubert, your professionalism, collaboration, and _next-level problem-solving wizardry_ make you an absolute legend. Your colleagues (all of us, obviously) think the world of you—and you inspire us every single day to aim higher and dream bigger. :rocket:
We’re beyond lucky to have you on this team, and we can’t wait to see what kind of amazingness you’ll unleash over the next five years (_spoiler alert: at Red Hat, of course!_) :smile:

[2025-01-14T15:01:28.864249] U0171SJF00H: just checked, <@UFB1TK0Q7> you're right, Quay changed their pricing plans, it used to be that we had 5 free private container repos, that doesn't appear to be the case anymore though...
I'll dig up the source article to get you that higher org tier with free repos
[2025-01-16T08:18:00.316149] U04MTUF83QX: <@U04PQB5SV41> I believe we usually don't want internal URLs to be public and there are a few in <https://gitlab.com/CentOS/automotive/sample-images/-/issues/28>

But now they're failing for a different reason:
Systemd is saying this:
```degraded
  UNIT                               LOAD   ACTIVE SUB    DESCRIPTION
● NetworkManager-wait-online.service loaded failed failed Network Manager Wait Online

LOAD   = Reflects whether the unit definition was properly loaded.
ACTIVE = The high-level unit activation state, i.e. generalization of SUB.
SUB    = The low-level unit activation state, values depend on unit type.```
<https://artifacts.osci.redhat.com/testing-farm/f3315b96-812c-4a78-b089-8e5a015c3f23/>
Any ideas why or why now and not before?
[2025-01-16T14:41:12.853189] U011CBYSALV: I would ask (maybe not just yet, but really soon) to stop making it optional. We need to identify these regressions when stuff gets merged/changed
[2025-01-16T14:43:13.455969] U011CBYSALV: even if it is just a flake.
[2025-01-16T14:43:54.115049] U011CBYSALV: interesting, I haven't seen it recently, <@U04NLT3HY3Y>, <https://artifacts.osci.redhat.com/testing-farm/f3315b96-812c-4a78-b089-8e5a015c3f23/work-QARegularcsmofdqy/> has useless console log again. what happened?
[2025-01-16T15:31:50.614489] UG0N57XEX: <@U02F2L89YTS> this test is valid .... it is looking for services which failed during boot, but reason why Network Manager failed is hard without console.log, as all logs which we have now are from test runtime and not from boot time
[2025-01-16T15:38:08.177799] U02F2L89YTS: Yeah, I was wondering why the service didn't fail before and it's failing now. What has changed? :thinking_face:
It could be a infra thing (it has happened before with lab or board network issues) or packages issues
[2025-01-16T17:55:48.530089] U011CBYSALV: or flake. without the cosole log it's moot until someone (or automation) runs it again. unless it also failed yesterday:)

[2025-01-17T12:47:36.007769] U02DXVBD5CP: 
[2025-01-17T14:55:10.490919] U04NLT3HY3Y: Hi all, I have seen a request that has a provisioning failure yesterday: `"message": "failed to verify SSH"`

There was a mismatch between image name and type, causing smoke test to fail.
[2025-01-29T12:23:35.662909] URH2PJUCV: tl;dr two MRs were posted for test-console for things we've noticed while working on <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2Ro7aBfIUw|a demo where TC talks with OpenShift>

hi!
yesterday we've presented the above mentioned demo in the gathering that takes place in Barcelona

for that, we needed to change the endpoint of testing farm that is currently hard-coded in TC, hence<https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/services/test-console/-/merge_requests/246| this MR>

we've also noticed that it takes long to build the container image of TC when making code changes, hence <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/services/test-console/-/merge_requests/245|this MR>

the task of generating a repot then failed, we've solved it by adding `RUN chmod 777 /test-console` to the Containerfile (as that's where the `_config.json` was written) but you may want to tackle it differently..

your review of these MRs and in general, engagement in this effort would be appreciated!
[2025-01-30T13:10:45.162849] U04PQB5SV41: Hi Team,

I recently discovered that the devel package has been added to the images and so when some tests that need it run, it registers as being installed, however the src that comes with the devel package is missing so the following error occurs when trying to build modules for test.
```09:18:23                 out: Package kernel-automotive-devel-5.14.0-522.471.el9iv.aarch64 is already installed.
...

09:18:28                 out: make[1]: Entering directory '/usr/src/kernels/5.14.0-522.471.el9iv.aarch64'^M
09:18:39                 out: Makefile:728: arch/aarch64/Makefile: No such file or directory^M
09:18:39                 out: make[1]: *** No rule to make target 'arch/aarch64/Makefile'.  Stop.^M
09:18:39                 out: make[1]: Leaving directory '/usr/src/kernels/5.14.0-522.471.el9iv.aarch64'^M
09:18:39                 out: make: *** [Makefile:6: all] Error 2^M```
When did this change take place? This was puzzling becaus eit works on the debug image but i see that on debug it is not on the image so the test has to insall it which gets all the right bits onto the system.
However you are adding this to the non debug kernel it is missing the full install needed to build. cc: <@UDAENJUEB> <@U02F2L89YTS>

[2025-02-03T12:15:58.999649] U02F2L89YTS: :redflag:RHIVOS pipeline broken :redflag:
During the weekend the Downstream pipeline has been broken and we haven't able to build a new compose or images since Thursday night.

The problem seems to be a dependency (`libselinux`) that was updated upstream, but not downstream. So, AutoSD has all the right versions and can build, but it looks like RHEL didn't updated that package, so all the packages that depended on it fail to install.
The problem should be fixed once RHEL fix the dependencies. In the mean time, <@U04NNGY4QQ2> is trying to pin the previous working version, so we can build the compose and images.

We'll let you know when we have more news.

<!channel>

[2025-02-03T13:52:25.183939] U02F2L89YTS: So, not really a RHEL dependency issue, but a RHIVOS gating issue.
Gator failed to gate a few packages on Friday due to a bug and `libselinux` was one of them.
The bug was fixed and now the gating is running.
We should have the correct version soon in the compose and the pipeline working again soon :pray:

[2025-02-04T10:22:03.906849] U04JRTQ4LHK: Can someone refresh my memory as to why <https://rhivos.auto-toolchain.redhat.com/in-vehicle-os-9/RHIVOS-1/RHIVOS-1.0-TechPreview/info.txt|RHIVOS-1.0-TechPreview> isn't the same thing (or newer) as <https://rhivos.auto-toolchain.redhat.com/in-vehicle-os-9/RHIVOS-1/RHIVOS-1.0-TechPreview-RC4/info.txt|RHIVOS-1.0-TechPreview-RC4>?
[2025-02-04T12:11:58.110559] U02F2L89YTS: When we started to do the re-spins, we override the TechPreview release. As you well know, it didn't go so well...
So, we started to create RC for that.
To avoid breaking links in polarion for results, we left the last TechPreview that we override with the same name/path.

So, the final TechPreview RC we built successfully is RC4.

*RHIVOS-1.0-TechPreview-RC4 -&gt; The newest and final one.*

I'd like to point TechPreview to RC4, but we need to think about how to do that without breaking links in polarion or anything else.

BTW, yes, we're fixing our release workflows to avoid this mess in the future.

[2025-02-05T16:45:22.877039] U04KM6EGXC3: Hi folks,

I would like to start a discussion to add a new parameter in the `test_images_info.json` file. I would like to add a new variable with the `COMPOSE_ID`, I know this information in a file call `COMPOSE_ID` (example: <https://rhivos.auto-toolchain.redhat.com/in-vehicle-os-9/RHIVOS-1/latest-RHIVOS-1/repos/RHIVOS/COMPOSE_ID>) and inside of the `rpms.json`file (<https://rhivos.auto-toolchain.redhat.com/in-vehicle-os-9/RHIVOS-1/latest-RHIVOS-1/repos/RHIVOS/compose/metadata/rpms.json>), but I don't want to get from those files.

I want to add it, and create a simple function or extend in <https://gitlab.com/redhat/edge/ci-cd/pipe-x/tf-requests/-/blob/main/src/tf_requests/get_auto_compose.py>. This file contains the logic to get the testing farm pool and the raw string with the compose, but we can't get the compose id, and get directly any file (`COMPOSE_ID` or `rpms.json`), but it breaks all the magic of the previous script and that script speaks about compose information.

Reviewing repositories (5 minutes), MR's must be done in:

• <https://gitlab.com/redhat/edge/ci-cd/pipe-x/tf-requests>
• <https://gitlab.com/redhat/edge/ci-cd/pipe-x/image-info-generator>
I don't know where it must be set in your pipelines when the images is created.

[2025-02-26T17:03:55.242849] U04N2DV1W3Y: Hi can someone please tell me the AWS environment we use in Toolchain ? This is related to the gcc tool qualification, ideally we want to run the tests in the same environment in which we build gcc in brew <https://brewweb.engineering.redhat.com/brew/hostinfo?hostID=509>
[2025-02-26T23:18:22.864089] U04PQB5SV41: Hi team, I just completed a build using the qa image for ridesx4 and noticed that the image size is 5G.
```[root@localhost ~]# df -h .
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/sde38      4.9G  2.7G  2.0G  58% /
[root@localhost ~]#```
I see there was a change 2 days ago to make this limit. But there is no `pi_resize` delivered to grow the partition. So this breaks the ridesx4 board for most kernel testing.
If `pi_resize` is not working on boot for the ridesx boards can we add a condition to the `qa.mpp.yml` to set the `image_size` to `17179824128`  for the ridesx4 boards? This is the size set in the defauts for ridesx4 but this change overrides the default. Thanks! cc: <@UDAENJUEB>
[2025-02-27T13:37:07.907999] U01TXCW3RMF: Hey everyone, realized the current ride4 images available won't work on the new v3 boards. Will need toolchain builds with `--target ridesx4_r3` eventually. Currently only boards 23-27 are V3 and aren't available on GCAL yet.
[2025-02-27T15:17:29.586879] U02JHD5HMGC: I merged a change for the ATC dashboard a few hours ago, and I thought it would propagate automagically to

I'm facing a weird issue when I'm trying to use the compose_id. I'm using the internal library[1], but to be faster I'm going to jump and see the info in `test_images_info.json`[2].

According to that info the compose ID is `RHIVOS-1.0-20250304.t.0`, I'm getting 404 [3] if I ask to CTS for this compose ID [4] and I try to get the json file with all RPM packages.

After that, I just make a broad query to CTS [5] and I got newer compose IDs, for example:

• RHIVOS-1.0-20250310.t.0
• RHIVOS-1.0-20250309.t.0
• RHIVOS-1.0-20250308.t.0
• RHIVOS-1.0-20250307.t.0

I can get the information about the last compose ID [6]

[2025-03-11T14:22:25.693989] U02F2L89YTS: <@U028G091SNM> we changed the image list almost a month ago. We send an email to the devel maillist about it.
This is the new list of images:
<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WkUrT8S4h7orbv2ckwJVxKBsLWhOep42QeZXeq6z4n0/edit?gid=1768104985#gid=1768104985>

Regarding the date for the images, we have been experiencing problems with some ridesx4 images and the pipeline have been blocked since then.
We are finishing a new build right now. So we should have new builds in one or two hours.
[2025-03-11T17:38:27.687229] U02F2L89YTS: Finally we have a new nightly build for RHIVOS: <https://rhivos.auto-toolchain.redhat.com/in-vehicle-os-9/RHIVOS-1/latest-RHIVOS-1/>

[2025-03-18T11:42:52.515299] UG137FY4U: I'm new to running `automotive-image-builder` but a build that ran fine yesterday is failing today, seemingly trying to pull RPM versions that don't exist. Do I need to reset something explicitly in my build environment?

[2025-03-18T12:05:37.324829] U02F2L89YTS: I guess it has to do with the fact that the image was build with one nightly compose, and now the nightly compose is different, so the dnf database cache has the wrong index or something.
But I thought the dnf cache was empty in a fresh new image :thinking_face:
[2025-03-18T12:08:25.407209] U04MTUF83QX: the dnf cache expires by default every 48h and that's aib's dnf's cache, so the local dnf

About `current available images`:

• Downstream/RHIVOS <https://rhivos.auto-toolchain.redhat.com/in-vehicle-os-9/RHIVOS-1/latest-RHIVOS-1/>
There were recent changes(Since Feb/1.0 Tech Preview release) which reduced created images(in Feb - please refer to mail "AutoSD/RHIVOS image list updated" so it seems that we currently have both Rpi4 and qemu on AutoSD and just qemu on RHIVOS.

Robert will take the rest of the week off-work to care for his family.
He will be back next week.
[2025-03-27T13:32:44.228139] U02F2L89YTS: :red_ball: Today's nightly build has an important and possible breaking change: we added the new `redhat-release-automotive` package. :red_ball:
Because that package change the files `/etc/os-release` and `/etc/redhat-release` to state that the release is `rhivos` instead of `rhel`, it might break some tests.
Please, if you see any weird behaviors in your tests, report them here.
We're building a new `latest` without that change, so it doesn't break anything else. I'll be available in ~ 3 hours.
Sorry for the inconveniences.

[2025-04-01T14:56:18.529029] U04JRTQ4LHK: Hi toolchain, it seems the "docker" runners are now gone in gitlab cee :) and we're meant to use the "shared-podman" runners now.  But in the <https://gitlab.com/redhat/edge/ci-cd/pipe-x/pipelines-as-code/-/blob/main/.gitlab/containers.yml?ref_type=heads#L28|container-build job hosted in pipe-x>, I saw now this is hardcoded to the "docker" runners.. Just a heads up, you may find some issues having hardcoded tags into the jobs to make them reusable in both <http://gitlab.com|gitlab.com> and gitlab cee now. You'll probably need to create an override version of the container-build job in downstream that fixes the tag, or remove the tags from the jobs..

[2025-04-08T13:44:43.071439] U020YLADEKA: HI <@U04AGQD0K8D>,
On today's ATC weekly meeting, we discussed about ESS and SOA deadlines and I want to have the team to have full clarity as we are close to the deadline and GA about what needs to be done and when.

AFAIK this is the timeline:
    ◦ July 2025 - <https://pp.engineering.redhat.com/rhivos-1.0/schedule/tasks/#red_hat_in_vehicle_operating_system_1_0.launch_phase|Production Launch> for 1.0GA
    ◦ PSSC only starts the SOA process upto 45 days before the release date (in our case May 2025)
    ◦ *We need to get all services ESS reviewed by April 30th*

1. Can you have a brief look on the state of things on the <https://issues.redhat.com/browse/VROOM-24606|EPIC> or <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1J6KqIrTH5aLMhsHKJrXlIm-MfPV_NZgG-ldaSAs0IDQ/edit|Sheet> and point to what needs to be completed by April30 and who should do it?
2. What happens if we do not get ESS reviewed by April30, how does that effect 1.0 GA?
3. WHat does ESS reviewed by April 30 means ? just to have the attestation info filled or an actual change/fix? 
4. What happens after April 30 till GA (July) on the SOA level until we reach GA, where can we see this work?

[2025-04-08T19:33:51.880829] U02F2L89YTS: The aib bug was <https://gitlab.com/CentOS/automotive/src/automotive-image-builder/-/merge_requests/274|fixed> and now we have a new aib version available (<https://brewweb.engineering.redhat.com/brew/buildinfo?buildID=3593750|0.7.0>).
We're testing it in this pipeline and it looks like the issue was solved :partying_face:

[2025-04-09T15:39:39.703709] U04JRTQ4LHK: &gt; For this particular release, we are not targeting to run the CTC.
<@U04KLL3QSF4> quick question: why aren't we running CTC for this release? Reason I ask, is if CTC did run for this release, we could shift our validator work to focus around this new release and resolve some issues that we have with TechPreview-RC4
[2025-04-09T19:42:16.164689] U04MGT65NQJ: :yellow_alert: All, tomorrow April 10th at 05:00AM UTC all AWS downstream runner pools (pipe-x, pipe-x-release, gating, services) will get a code update. The update is deployed to the pools in a rolling fashion guaranteeing continuity of service for new jobs. But jobs already running when the update starts might be terminated abruptly without notice. The update is supposed to last approximately 10 minutes. Please plan your pipeline invocations accordingly. A separate message will be sent once the update is complete. Thank you

[2025-04-10T10:43:17.247639] U06J9AHRB37: Good morning,
I tried to flash a ridesx board this morning with the following <https://rhivos.auto-toolchain.redhat.com/in-vehicle-os-9/RHIVOS-1/latest-RHIVOS-1/RideSX4/auto-osbuild-ridesx4_r3-rhivos-qa-regular-aarch64-11321809.de2ae803.aboot/|image> taken from the toolchain.
I noticed I had no ip assigned to the board, does anyone know what I can do in this case?

[2025-04-15T19:19:32.568969] U04QDJC59E2: I was attempting to capture some boot time data on a Ride 4 V3 with an AutoSD R3 nightly image from 4/13, but wasn't able to successfully boot. At first glance, it seems like a dependency issue with QM? Does anyone have any insight?
[2025-04-15T19:21:52.164939] U0205F28UMN: It looks like either the directory /var/qm doesn't exist so it can't mount the partition to that or.. that the partition doesn't exist in the image and so it can't mount that
[2025-04-15T19:38:56.627199] U04QDJC59E2: Is there way to confirm or rectify this from the emergency shell? Or is it an issue with the image? It does look like the /var/qm dir does exist

[2025-04-15T19:40:42.834759] U0205F28UMN: if that doesn't exist I would say it is a problem with the image.
[2025-04-15T19:41:01.360809] U0205F28UMN: I would consider that a 'hard fail' of some sort

First it said there was component/build name mismatch, but the Jira ticket has "redhat-release-automotive" set as the component. Okay, this was just a warning and I could proceed. Then it complained about missing product listings for this package. I've tried reloading those (there was a button) but it still didn't help. Do you know what might be wrong?

The new parallel pipelines for RHIVOS are failing due some issues with brew tags, packages signed and some missing configs.
We're working on having them fixed today, so we can have the new `latest-RHIVOS-1.0` and `latest-RHIVOS-1.1` built. And to be able to build the release tomorrow.

[2025-05-06T12:48:43.831139] U04AGQD0K8D: Hi All,
This is follow up on what we discussed in y'day's meeting:
We are almost reaching the end of remediation tasks due date for "VHCL-012 Authorization &amp; Authentication". Out of the 2 options that we have:
a) Extend the remediation tasks to be compliant for these controls
b) Get permanent exception.

As we don't plan to work on remediation anytime soon because of GA &amp; issues which will be caused by extra auth layer we decided to go with option(b)
<@U02F2L89YTS> <@U02DXVBD5CP><@U020YLADEKA> <@U04N9LTR47M>: As permanent exception will go through Infosec VP approval we need to provide as much  justification as possible. If you have any thoughts, documentation or further justification please provide here.

[2025-05-07T13:18:51.709629] UG137FY4U: I've got a weird problem with automotive-image-builder causing a build failure. I'm getting a 404 on the repo:

<https://autosd.sig.centos.org/AutoSD-9/nightly/repos/AutoSD/compose/AutoSD/aarch64/os/repodata/repomd.xml>

But if I URL-hack this to remove the repomd.xml, I get a valid directory:

<https://autosd.sig.centos.org/AutoSD-9/nightly/repos/AutoSD/compose/AutoSD/aarch64/os/repodata/>

And from there if I navigate to the repomd.xml I get a good file, but the root URL changes:

<https://download.autosd.sig.centos.org/nightly/repos/AutoSD/compose/AutoSD/aarch64/os/repodata/repomd.xml>
[2025-05-07T13:21:38.249789] U04MTUF83QX: <@UG137FY4U> cf the thread with Hubert just above
[2025-05-07T13:30:13.770589] U011CBYSALV: <@U020YLADEKA> <@U0171SJF00H> if you don't find a solution, can we revert that ASAP? it's unrealistic to change the numerous places where the "old" URL is hardcoded  in short time.
[2025-05-07T23:22:30.165779] U02F2L89YTS: We reverted the changes related to the AutoSD repos. It should be working fine now. We did a few tests and everything is working again.

[2025-05-08T13:26:38.329449] UG137FY4U: We have an AIB manifest that is trying to place a `/var/lib/webui/index.html` file on the system. This works fine in package mode, but fails in image mode. The `/var/lib/webui` directory gets created, and other files related to this get placed correctly on the system, but this one `index.html` file is simply missing from the build in image mode. Does anyone have a clue why this might happen?
[2025-05-08T13:28:17.364159] U0205F28UMN: probably need the manifest

[2025-05-08T13:36:34.934679] U0205F28UMN: ok that is weird.. I was thinking it might be a container layer not seeing it or a selinux permission issue. [actually does it work if selinux is permissive?]
[2025-05-08T14:25:03.927679] U04MTUF83QX: it's expected, `/var` isn't part of the ostree commit
[2025-05-08T14:28:32.917199] U02F2L89YTS: Already solved on the aib channel

[2025-05-14T13:25:12.532999] U011CBYSALV: <@U02F2L89YTS> btw what is the "nmstate test" that you mention as a reason for adding iputils?
[2025-05-14T15:01:02.819449] U03DM1LN4UW: What is the brew tag that is pulled from to build the release repo?
[2025-05-14T15:01:33.902259] U03DM1LN4UW: I assume its rhivos-1.0.0
[2025-05-14T15:01:45.119659] U02DXVBD5CP: rhivos-1.0.0-candidate
[2025-05-14T15:02:35.936639] U03DM1LN4UW: let me ask a clarifying question then - is that just for the rc? or will that be the one that is used on release day?
[2025-05-14T15:03:16.798559] U02DXVBD5CP: it is for RC and will be promoted to pending and rhivos-1.0.0
[2025-05-14T15:05:59.072959] U04NNGY4QQ2: When we have the GA available in July we will push the builds to rhivos-1.0.0 tag. However, rhivos-1.0.0-candidate is used for the RC and the builds in this tag will be pushed to rhivos-1.0.0 on the release day.
[2025-05-14T18:29:57.397409] U04NN2GEXLZ: By the way, neither I nor <@U04NHTDFS6P> will be able to attend the sprint planning tomorrow. Is there anything you need we might be able to clarify beforehand?
[2025-05-14T18:41:36.891399] U03DM1LN4UW: <@U04NN2GEXLZ> will the z-stream updates go to brewtag rhivos-1.0.0? or will that be a different tag?
[2025-05-14T18:43:29.820129] U04NN2GEXLZ: No, `rhivos-1.0.0` will remain unchanged forever. Updates to that release will be landing in `rhivos-1.0.0-z` once they go out, and `rhivos-1.0.0-z-candidate` during integration.
[2025-05-14T18:43:43.907129] U04NN2GEXLZ: The same schema RHEL uses.
[2025-05-14T19:17:04.036179] U04JPFBCSTB: <@U04NN2GEXLZ> I thought rhivos-1.0.z would be the destination for updates until rhivos-1.0.1-candidate is created and later released as rhivos-1.0.1
[2025-05-14T19:27:40.638989] U04NN2GEXLZ: <@U04JPFBCSTB> You might be mixing a number of things here.

• `rhivos-1.0`, `rhivos-1.0.z`, `rhivos-1.0.1`, `rhivos-1.0.2`, `rhivos-1.0.3` are Jira releases and really only exist there
• from product release perspective (in Errata Tool), there are two "products" per Y-stream release: `RHIVOS-1.0.0` and `RHIVOS-1.0.0-Z`
• in Brew structures, everything maps to the two "products" above, with tag prefixed with `rhivos-1.0.0` and `rhivos-1.0.0-z` respectively (e.g. `rhivos-1.0.0-candidate` or `rhivos-1.0.0-z-pesign-build`)
• in dist-git, we have development and stable branches, like `rhivos-1-main`, which always targets the next Y-stream, and `rhivos-1.0.0`, which is used during the stabilization period (starting when the underlying RHEL release branches), as well as for all Z updates afterwards
The 1.0.1-3 releases in Jira don't really "exist" as a separate thing, they're scheduled bundles of Z updates. This maps to the concept of RHEL batch updates. Hope that makes it a bit clearer.
[2025-05-15T09:36:41.310779] U011CBYSALV: the autosd webserver still seems to be broken
redirect/listing for URL without trailing / is wrong:
```curl <https://autosd.sig.centos.org/nightly/repos/AutoSD/compose/AutoSD/aarch64/os>
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN">
&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;301 Moved Permanently&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Moved Permanently&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The document has moved &lt;a href="<http://autosd.sig.centos.org:8080/nightly/repos/AutoSD/compose/AutoSD/aarch64/os/>"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Roni started his journey with RH back on April 15, 2018, joining the legendary RHV QE Network team. A couple of years later, he followed his passion and moved to the RHV DevOps team, and in early 2023, he jumped into the fast lane with the automotive toolchain team.
Roni’s known for always bringing fresh ideas to the table, being super helpful and approachable, and having a deep understanding of infrastructure.
This year, he’s been leading a major push around Test Console—driving optimizations and new implementations as part of a broader initiative to improve end-to-end testing and infrastructure.
Roni—it's truly awesome working and brainstorming with you. Here’s to many more fun, impactful years together at Red Hat! :rocket:

I also need to understand what tickets, if any, you're pulling into the RHIVOS advisories for the RHEL 9.6. I see that you're cloning previously published RHEL 9.6 advisories, <@U04KLL3QSF4>, and making advisories for individual RHEL builds that don't already have a RHEL 9.6 advisory. I want to confirm that the content we have scripted in errata_doc_approver.py is still appropriate for the methods you're using to generate the RHIVOS 1.0 errata advisories.

Are either or both of you available to meet and coordinate about these questions sometime this week? If so, send me an invitation. I know we all have a well-earned recharge this week, so I'll do my best to shuffle meetings to accommodate whatever time you can spare. Thanks!

[2025-05-27T05:41:59.662769] UDLVC8W83: Hi, I encountered an issue where a validator <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/contcert/foa-validators/glibc-tests/-/jobs/34912941|run> in our CI takes over an hour.
A month ago, the same validator <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/contcert/foa-validators/glibc-tests/-/jobs/33711615|run> (maybe with minor changes) took ~13min. The validator designed to checks multiple results in <http://artifacts.osci.redhat.com/testing-farm/>
I suspect it may be related to slow network; since we disabled the shared CEE GitLab runners and switched to a self hosted set of runners hosted by toolchain team. any idea?

[2025-06-09T13:00:05.639269] U020YLADEKA: Hi folks, happy Monday!
A kind reminder about Tomorrow(June 10) planned AI hackathon instead of the usual ATC weekly(using the same time slot) .
Please help in adding your latest focus area data sources[1](docs, slides, markdowns, pictures etc) to this <https://notebooklm.google.com/notebook/8abe43c7-0e34-4fc8-9775-a1e96e96f8e5|Automotive Toolchain documentation(AI style) notebook>  => CORRECTED THE LINK

In the May 20 ATC weekly mtg, we discussed an interesting option for creating a new joint ToolChain documentation using <https://notebooklm.google.com/|notebookLM> to aggregate our most updated knowledge per focus area.
The plan was to use this 1H meeting to create an initial ATC knowledge base using notebookLM.

The simplest option to start with this seems like:
1. Manually add all the latest information sources to this <https://notebooklm.google.com/notebook/8abe43c7-0e34-4fc8-9775-a1e96e96f8e5|Automotive Toolchain documentation(AI style) notebook> I shared with you.
2. Tomorrow: play around with it in our 1H and refine and see it ready to be shared.
3. Share this in/out of the team so anyone can ask the AI chatbox in that notebook any Q about anything at ATC can find it easily and not need to go through different notebooks per focus area.
WDYT?

I'm open to suggestions if anything else is more intresting or in the 1H time frame for AI hackathon to the team or has changed since the May20 meeting.
Let me know if you need more time, we can also push this to next week if it's too tight.

So we have something to explore, can you please help in adding all the latest information sources to this <https://notebooklm.google.com/notebook/34636dcb-f1e2-4577-bf48-dcf02871e468|Automotive Toolchain documentation(AI style) notebook> ? ( if the data source can not be added directly to the notebook, please add this in this <https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1nPWkU88N6OeFNyVRN0iSU9HqmxnYivJz|G-drive > and we'll see how to add it later)
It will be helpful to rename the sources so we know what focus area it came from e.g <pipelies/gating/TF_integration/... >

Checkout supported data sources and limitations at these nice <https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1TFGmDgqbRCKqxQL3OBjONgJj0FYzhgsR1pqF9bakWEM/edit|slides> for basic usage a WA's.
[2025-06-09T14:57:02.976219] U04AXB4GK52: Hi all, I see in the <https://rhivos.auto-toolchain.redhat.com/in-vehicle-os-9/RHIVOS-1/RHIVOS-1.0.0-RC2/package-tests-results/|RHIVOS-1.0.0 RC2 package tests> that `kernel-automotive-debug` is listed as a package. As far as I can tell `kernel-automotive-debug` is not a package, but an RPM from `kernel-automotive` builds. Is it expected and/or common practice to see an individual RPM in the package tests?
[2025-06-09T15:50:38.116549] U020YLADEKA: `I think it'd be useful for the AI Hackaton and for later, to create one notebook per focus area and then one for the whole team.`
We can also do one notebook per focus area - I did not want to overwhelm the team with too much in 1H so one notebook for all the ATC team focus areas was the easier thing for tommrow .
[2025-06-10T07:19:41.696149] U020YLADEKA: I created a short Vid that shows the flow of how to use Gemini to create a Google Doc out of a code repo so it's more visible and easily consumed by notebookLM.
I used test-console cloned repo and created a doc with the repo overview and fed it to notebookLM as a s source.

This can be used to prepare the docs needed for today AI hackaton or we can do it doing the hackaton itself :slightly_smiling_face:

[2025-06-12T14:15:15.036479] U04NNGY4QQ2: Hi <@U04MTUF83QX>, <@U04JCEH31RV>
We're currently testing a change in the RHIVOS/AutoSD compose structure to enable `hashed_directories` (<https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/rhivos/-/merge_requests/564|MR>). With this change, instead of all RPMs being placed under a single `Packages/` directory (like we have now <https://rhivos.auto-toolchain.redhat.com/in-vehicle-os-9/RHIVOS-1/latest-RHIVOS-1/repos/RHIVOS/compose/RHIVOS/aarch64/os/Packages/>), they will now be grouped into subdirectories based on their names (e.g., `a/`, `b/`,  <https://download-01.beak-001.prod.iad2.dc.redhat.com/odcs/prod/odcs-4239707/compose/RHIVOS/aarch64/os/Packages/>).

From what we've observed so far, product build pipelines are functioning correctly with this updated structure. However, before moving forward, I wanted to check if this change might impact any documentation, or have any implications for customers or the community that we should be aware of.

Appreciate your input on this!

The only way I've been able to reproduce this panic is by passing a value of `""` for the environment variable `CTCL_AWS_REGION`, which in the <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/downstream-pipelines-as-code/-/blame/main/.gitlab/extends.yml?ref_type=heads#L562|pipeline definition> is set like `CTCL_AWS_REGION: "${AWS_CTCL_REGION}"`. So far I have no way to know how the value for this variable could have ended up empty given it was previously set to `us-east-1` (it should have been `eu-west-1` so I corrected that today). If you have any insight you might be able to share I'd appreciate it.

Happy Monday, everyone! This past weekend (Saturday, July 5th) marked *Robert’s 4th anniversary* with Red Hat!
*Please join me in congratulating him on this fantastic milestone —* *Happy Anniversary, Robert!*:partying_face:

Robert, beyond being a passionate music lover, talented saxophonist, and awesome band member, you're also an outstanding engineer.
Your dedication and expertise as the *Testing Farm focal* have been invaluable — from helping with any board issue and integrating new boards, to collaborating across teams with Toolchain and QE. Your efforts have enabled the RHIVOS/TF teams to seamlessly run critical workloads on release CTCs and RAs across target hardware platforms.
Your proactive mindset, improvements in monitoring, and constant willingness to help others truly make a difference.
I deeply appreciate everything you bring to the team — both technically and personally.
Keep up the great work, and most importantly — *keep having fun along the way!* :notes::clap:

The tool needs to be executed for each nvr in the core-rpm and takes several hours to run.
IMO, we should separate the script from the validator. The script will run independently somewhere and save the results, while the validator only checks those results.
Is it feasible to host it as part of the product-build?

2. Most likely not that one specific Distrobaker; to make it more confusing, the OSCI team broke it down into several smaller derived services and kept using the distrobaker account name, but they're not running the linked code; that one is kind of obsolete, I believe.

[2025-07-23T07:52:19.073059] U04NNGY4QQ2: :rocket: *[UPDATE] AutoSD &amp; RHIVOS-1 Nightly Builds Are Back!*
We’re happy to share that after a long period of downtime, *<https://autosd.sig.centos.org/AutoSD-9/nightly/|AutoSD>* and *<https://rhivos.auto-toolchain.redhat.com/in-vehicle-os-9/RHIVOS-1/latest-RHIVOS-1/|RHIVOS-1> nightly builds* are now available again.
 You can resume using the latest builds as usual.
Apologies for the inconvenience, and thanks for your patience!
[2025-07-23T10:47:23.903519] U02JHD5HMGC: In relation to the nightly job failing in past week, does it make sense to now review the smoke test job timeout and retries?
There are 3 retries, and a 4 hour timeout on the smoke test.  One of the nightly jobs took 16 hours to run and then report issue, during the TF outage.  That delays the alert and then responding to a problem.
For the smoke test, in the past, we did not limit how many TC jobs could run in the pool, so smoke test could fail if no board was available to run a job.  This took 12 hours for retry and timeout combination.

I can add a ticket to monitoring epic to investigate how to display the pipeline duration on the dashboard, and compare the 2 streams.
[2025-07-25T10:45:58.603629] U02JHD5HMGC: Hi, I was experimenting with some visualization of pipelines, and have added some code to <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/metrics/gitlab>

I'm working with some BSPs and have product artifacts of a considerable size, up to 30 GB.
I had these artifacts built on a Beaker machine and then stored them locally on my PC.

I have Google Drive as a last resort, but I wonder if there's a more appropriate place to store and share them.
Any suggestion would be very much appreciated.

[2025-08-27T01:29:38.714169] U028G091SNM: Hey Toolchain team

Wondering about this function from get_auto_compose:
<https://gitlab.com/redhat/edge/ci-cd/pipe-x/tf-requests/-/blob/main/src/tf_requests/get_auto_compose.py?ref_type=heads#L52>

We are trying to use the helper to get a image name for latest QEMU to integrate into test pipelines which would then make the call to Testing Farm to provision the VM, but it seams that this function is specifically designed only for other use, by these variable being required `aws_regions = [os.environ.get("AWS_TF_REGION"), os.environ.get("AWS_CKI_REGION")]`
Is there a way we could patch this to just provide universally the image name requested?

Or am I not calling something properly?
```get_automotive_tf_compose --arch aarch64 --webserver-releases <http://rhivos.auto-toolchain.redhat.com/in-vehicle-os-9/RHIVOS-1> --release latest-RHIVOS-1 --get-compose --hw-target qemu --image-type regular --image-name qa

[2025-09-09T15:20:29.855019] U028G091SNM: Hi ATC team,

Not sure if I should just write a ticket or make an issue somewhere, but we seam to be missing `cloud-utils-growpart`on x86 images :slightly_smiling_face:
[2025-09-10T12:17:06.959799] U0171SJF00H: Anyone else also having issues accessing jira?
[2025-09-10T12:17:52.650199] U0171SJF00H: (nvm, it just loaded, very slow though :turtle:)
[2025-09-11T10:20:33.880509] U02JHD5HMGC: Eitan noticed the ATC dashboard is not currently running.
Although there were 2 MR updates to ubi and packages, I don't believe they're connected.
It appears like an expired token, ticket is <https://issues.redhat.com/browse/VROOM-32903>
Has anyone seen any messages about expired tokens in past 24-48 hours?
[2025-09-11T11:17:08.929389] U0171SJF00H: >  Your Group access token `schedule-job-token-renew` for `automotive/pipe-x` will expire in 7 days or less.
This is the one I see from my notifications. don't see anything else from a date that would match :thinking_face:
[2025-09-11T11:17:51.312359] U0171SJF00H: or, is this another token for something else?
[2025-09-11T15:11:55.167129] U02JHD5HMGC: <@U0171SJF00H> not for today, but now that the ATC dashboard is running again, the gitlab pipelines for autosd and rhivos are blank, which is where those `401 Unauthorizeed` messages were coming from earlier.
I'm not sure when the tokens were generated, I'm guessing Michael did that in the ye olden times, in early 2024.
So I think we need new tokens for dashboard, that are not user tokens.
EDIT: local container with my personal tokens work, and get gitlab metrics
Can I sync up on Friday?

[2025-09-29T08:53:46.147389] U04MGT65NQJ: Hi all,
Recently we have been instructed by IT to secure our IAM configuration on AWS. This entails using SSO login to AWS accounts from the command line, removing and not creating 'personal' AWS users for associates, and rolling service account credentials yearly. To be able to enforce these policies I have removed associates from the `admin` roles of the three ATC accounts `aws-ateam-stage` `aws-internal-ateam` and `aws-ateam`. These associates have full permissions to do anything besides IAM actions in these accounts via the `poweruser` role to which they are assigned via the corresponding rover groups `it-cloud-aws-&lt;account_number&gt;-poweruser` . If anybody is not on the poweruser group and needs to be please LMK and I will add you.
Thanks and sorry for the late notification.
P.S. to set up SSO access to AWS via the command line please see this <https://spaces.redhat.com/x/C4BTKQ|page>.

[2025-09-29T14:25:59.098889] U03DQ7V743D: Hi folks!
I built and released the BlueChi v1.1.0-1.el10 RPM recently for RHIVOS 2.0:
<https://brewweb.engineering.redhat.com/brew/buildinfo?buildID=3856271>
I see it got the `rhivos-2.0-gate` tag applied. Is there already automation in place to apply additional tags? (e.g. `-candidate`) Or do I need to tag it manually?
[2025-09-29T14:27:47.900469] U02DXVBD5CP: you don't have to, the package gate job will do that
[2025-09-29T14:29:05.501609] U03DQ7V743D: How long will it (or is it expected to) take?
[2025-09-29T14:30:18.360389] U02DXVBD5CP: just checked the schedule, in 8 hours probably
[2025-09-29T14:30:50.680649] U0171SJF00H: I'll trigger it manually, if we need it urgently
[2025-09-30T06:33:51.477419] U03DQ7V743D: Good morning!
I see the pipeline ran, but there is still only the `-gate` tag on BlueChi:
<https://brewweb.engineering.redhat.com/brew/buildinfo?buildID=3856271>

which I don't think is good experience for GA, especially when it has issue, I am not sure where exactly to raise SKU change (or what I think will be change of EID 931 in SKU), but I think those 0.8 repos should not be enabled/active by default:

As part of the enablement work for RHIVOS-2, we will be updating the S3 bucket path currently used in the Toolchain portal:  <https://rhivos.auto-toolchain.redhat.com/>

*What is changing?*
• The existing directory *`in-vehicle-os-9`* will be renamed to *`in-vehicle-os`*.
    ◦ Before: <https://rhivos.auto-toolchain.redhat.com/in-vehicle-os-9/>
    ◦ *After*: <https://rhivos.auto-toolchain.redhat.com/>*in-vehicle-os/*
• This change is needed to ensure that RHIVOS-2 builds can be populated in the same directory alongside RHIVOS-1 builds.
• All services and components that reference *`in-vehicle-os-9`* must be updated to reference *`in-vehicle-os`* to avoid broken dependencies.
*Impact:*
• If your repositories or scripts hardcode the path *`in-vehicle-os-9`*, you will need to update them.
• Starting *early next week*, we are going to support both *`in-vehicle-os-9`* and *`in-vehicle-os`* but later *`in-vehicle-os-9`* will be deprecated and no longer maintained.
*Action Required:*
• Please review your repositories and adjust any references to use *`in-vehicle-os`* instead of *`in-vehicle-os-9`* before the deprecation date.
*Why this change?*
This update standardizes the naming convention and ensures RHIVOS-2 builds are aligned under a unified *`in-vehicle-os`* directory with RHIVOS-1.
Thank you for making the necessary adjustments. If you have any questions or concerns, please reach out via this thread or in the <#C04JDFLHJN6|> channel.
