Title: Introducing Plan Mode · Cursor
If you're using Cursor for creating new projects or features for your projects, this new feature could be useful. I've just tried and it's looking good.
If you normally as Cursor to create a detailed plan before starting to work, this is similar, but it's more integrated. It ask you some questions to clarify the goal and constraints and the create a detailer plan and ToDo. It saves the plan in markdown for future reference or changing stuff. Then you hit "build" and it start building the project/feature.

Title: Red Hat / Edge / ci-cd / AI Code Review · GitLab
AI-powered code review tool with local Git, remote MR/PR analysis, and CI integration (GitLab or GitHub)
Title: ai-code-review-cli
FYI, I published the pip package for my project <https://gitlab.com/redhat/edge/ci-cd/ai-code-review|ai-code-review>:
<https://pypi.org/project/ai-code-review-cli/>
`ai-code-review` was already taken :confused:
I also changed the README to make it more end-user focused. So ppl can use it right away, even locally (with pipx or using the container)
And I added a webpage to explain simply the project and its features:
<https://ai-code-review-fd7894.gitlab.io/>

I hope you like it. And any feedback is welcome :slightly_smiling_face:
