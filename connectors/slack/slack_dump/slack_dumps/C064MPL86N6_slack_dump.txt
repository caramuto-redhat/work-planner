[2025-10-01T04:29:35.918179] Kanitha Chim: Hi, <@U04JJADSWGM> do you know why ET doesn't re-fetch the test result automatically? we already have result for this build <https://resultsdb.engineering.redhat.com/results?item:like=aboot*&amp;testcases=rhivos.brew-build.functional-safety.continuous-certification&amp;since=2025-09-02T00%3A00%3A00%2C2025-10-01T23%3A59%3A59|https://resultsdb.engineering.redhat.com/results?item:like=aboot*&amp;testcases=rhivos.brew-build[â€¦]ce=2025-09-02T00%3A00%3A00%2C2025-10-01T23%3A59%3A59>
but ET last result was 2 months ago <https://errata.engineering.redhat.com/advisory/148805/test_run/rhivos_compose_fusa_gate>
[2025-10-06T02:54:11.493379] Marcel Banas: Hello,
kindly asking for one more review on <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/release-definitions/-/merge_requests/18>
Thanks in advance :thanks-ty:
[2025-10-09T09:07:48.570699] Marcel Banas: Hello <@U04VATC9REZ>, <@U064YNKHH43>, <@U04JJADSWGM>,
we received validator results for RHIVOS compose fusa gate tests in Errata, but it doesn't look like they are updated automatically in Errata.
For example for this <https://errata.engineering.redhat.com/advisory/149342/test_run/rhivos_compose_fusa_gate|advisory>, when manually refetching, the test passes. I wanted to ask, as by discussion in this <https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHELWF-13104|ticket> I believe there is no Errata API for this functionality, if there is any way to refetch for large number of advisories other than manual via UI?

Thanks in advance :thanks-ty:
[2025-10-13T08:55:32.754129] Ryan Smith: <@U04KLL3QSF4> since Kanitha is OOO do you know how to request access to embargoed advisories? Looks like our GA batch has one and I will need to be able to access at least the test runs for that advisory in order to complete <https://issues.redhat.com/browse/VROOM-25374|VROOM-25374>
