Hi, May I ask you to for review of
https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/contcert/contcert-validator-config/-/merge_requests/590 ?
It is simple patch to remove validator.

Hi team, our colleague, Lumir, from over in the Python in RHEL team wanted to test run a RHEL
workflow presentation about his packages tomorrow with me before a bigger presentation in the RHEL
space. I invited the team to join if anyone would like to hear about how they're developing their
package in the RHEL space. Although Python is not in our scope, maybe this helps broaden some
insight into the RHEL development workflow :meow_smile: You'll have an invite in your emails titled
"Workflow sharing session [dry run]".

From: Iker Galardi
----------------------------------------
@Michael Ho it is non-blocking. This validator will fail in pre-prod run and will only fix when all
the tests downstream in QE repo replaces dmesg uses with journal plugin. Actually it's way beyond
that. Unless all the tests that refer the top level fmf in the QE repo switch to journal the
validator will keep failing

Hi everyone, just a heads up to those doing validator triage and what not -
`glibc-revdep-preload-modules` ran yesterday and completed with a `Failure` result. All I can share
from it, though, are the logs from Splunk because somehow the outputs are gone. We're still
investigating this, so more to come.

:rotating_light: *Heads up: Migration Notice: Renaming in-vehicle-os-9 to in-vehicle-os*
:rotating_light:
As part of the enablement work for RHIVOS-2, we will be updating the S3 bucket path currently used
in the Toolchain portal: https://rhivos.auto-toolchain.redhat.com/
*What is changing?* • The existing directory *`in-vehicle-os-9`* will be renamed to
*`in-vehicle-os`*. ◦ Before: https://rhivos.auto-toolchain.redhat.com/in-vehicle-os-9/ ◦ *After*:
https://rhivos.auto-toolchain.redhat.com/*in-vehicle-os/* • This change is needed to ensure that
RHIVOS-2 builds can be populated in the same directory alongside RHIVOS-1 builds. • All services and
components that reference *`in-vehicle-os-9`* must be updated to reference *`in-vehicle-os`* to
avoid broken dependencies. *Impact:* • If your repositories or scripts hardcode the path
*`in-vehicle-os-9`*, you will need to update them. • Starting *early next week*, we are going to
support both *`in-vehicle-os-9`* and *`in-vehicle-os`* but later *`in-vehicle-os-9`* will be
deprecated and no longer maintained. *Action Required:* • Please review your repositories and adjust
any references to use *`in-vehicle-os`* instead of *`in-vehicle-os-9`* before the deprecation date.
*Why this change?* This update standardizes the naming convention and ensures RHIVOS-2 builds are
aligned under a unified *`in-vehicle-os`* directory with RHIVOS-1. Thank you for making the
necessary adjustments. If you have any questions or concerns, please reach out via this thread or in
the #C04JDFLHJN6| channel.

where a lot of results are missing or failing, but also on merge request workflow, because unit
tests (https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/contcert/foa-validators/code-review/-/jobs/41248314)
depend on that. See: https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHELBLD-17379. Please if you have better idea

(VROOM-33457 (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/VROOM-33457)) for my deployment ticket
(https://issues.redhat.com/browse/VROOM-30938). It is closed since the validator is not marked as

directly related to journald check plugin validator is still in process that is gonna replace dmesg

Happy Friday. I created a proposal/outline
(https://docs.google.com/document/d/17BWjD-UDSp5T0BzYLzRxZWOxDRVETjemgY6Jaw0Rr2w/edit?tab=t.0) for
the template based documentation creation which I presented in our last team meeting. I am proposing
this as one of the ways we can overcome our documentation tech debt. This will also make sure that
we apply syntactic and semantic uniformity across validators.

Hi, can you please clarify what problem you are trying to solve?
I skimmed through the google doc and the MR and can't fully understand.
Specifically: • Does the MR automatically handle/verify/whatever docstrings of functions other than
initial_mode/continues_mode/entrypoint? • Specifically e.g. `packages_not_in_core_rpm_list`, there?
• If yes, how/where? • If not, is there a need to fix docstrings for
initial_mode/continues_mode/entrypoint? What is it? Thanks

  Thread Reply 65 - 2025-10-20 04:29
  From: Iker Galardi
  --------------------------------------
The MR has a tool which can be used to create docstring for all the validators in the repository, by
providing metadata(metadata.json). This metadata can be created by the AI agent parsing the code or
manually feed. The tool follows a template which can be defined for the docstring to be created.

We have a tech debt to create docstring for the validators and we also need have it uniform across
the validators. I have tried to capture these in the doc. @U03NPDKU3S8 could you comment on the docs
as well, the areas which are not clear or in the MR

The idea is to fully automate the docstring creation, does that sound useless to you?

Only for these 3 functions? Why do they need a docstring?

Not only for these 3 but for all of the validator code. The tool is not complete and I bet you
haven't gone through the proposal doc completely :slightly_smiling_face:

So the complete idea in a nutshell is Doc agent-&gt;creates metadata-&gt;User creates
template-&gt;Tool creates final Docstring and updates validator code

If all the MR is about is: Automate generation of docstrings for these 3, based on a template, then
I'd say: Why do they need a docstring?

The idea is to • To control the semantic and structure of the documentation • Generate the docstring
automatically

&gt; Automate generation of docstrings for these 3, based on a template, For all the sources of the
validator(this is configurable as well in case we wish to control)

&gt; To control the semantic Automatically? As in, have tooling that would tell you: Your docstring
says that your function does something, but the code actually does something else? &gt; and
structure Ok for me to require a specific structure. &gt; of the documentation

> As in, have tooling that would tell you: Your docstring says that your function does something,
but the code actually does something else? This gets synced by metadata. In the doc I have explained
that the metadata gets extracted by the agent(LLM). Actually your statement is more true in case we
manage it manually, where we might document something but forget to update it when we changed the
module source
