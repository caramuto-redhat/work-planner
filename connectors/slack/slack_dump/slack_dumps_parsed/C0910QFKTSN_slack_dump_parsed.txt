I don't know if you watched the video that Petr shared about Cloud Code
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&amp;t=6s) (which he used for his project), but it's
very interesting. The problem is that you need a pro account for anthropic. Very recently, Google
released a similar tool (but open source): Gemini cli (https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli)
Here is the blog post talking about it:
https://blog.google/technology/developers/introducing-gemini-cli-open-source-ai-agent/ It's
basically the same tool (same options and ui), but working with gemini instead of claude, Well, and
it's free, no need for a paid account. But it doesn't work (yet) with our RH account, but it works
with your personal one. Although, I'm not sure about if we can use it for internal stuff. They say
that those tools don't share the local stuff, but I don't really see how they can read and modify
your code without sending it to the remote LLM server... Very interesting tools for coding, working
with agents and MCPs.

I was playning with gemini-cli and created a small project
(https://github.com/ozanunsal/pipelinebot) for checking our product build pipeline status. Finds the
failed jobs, if it is failed in testing-farm, it traces testing-farm logs for the error log. Then it
finds the possible cause of error and suggests how to fix. Here is an example of a failed pipeline
(https://gitlab.com/redhat/edge/ci-cd/pipe-x/pipelines-as-code/-/pipelines/1889153567);
```(venv) ounsal@ounsal-thinkpadp16vgen1:~/repo/playground/pipeline-bot$ pipelinebot --project

ANALYSIS REPORT ================================================================================ Job
1: smoke-tests-fusa-minimal: [x86_64] Reason: The boot validation process failed because the
configuration for the 'qm' container has an incorrect checksum. This indicates that the container's

unintentional, revert the 'qm' container's configuration to its original state so that it matches
the expected checksum (`28ea142bf3a1720172251131e30f463305515a26ac76009f64f6b9a71af333b6`).

changes to the 'qm' container are intentional, update the expected checksum in the boot check
configuration file located at `/usr/lib/boot-check.d/qm.conf`. 2. If the container configuration
change was unintentional, revert the 'qm' container to its original state or rebuild the image to
ensure its checksum matches the expected value.``` When I actually checked the cause of failure, I
can say that gemini made a really good process.
I repeated it with a successful pipeline. To see whether I am having false-negative results and it
also worked. ```(venv) ounsal@ounsal-thinkpadp16vgen1:~/repo/playground/pipeline-bot$ pipelinebot

================================================================================ ðŸš€ PIPELINE FAILURE

jobs passed! ðŸŽ‰``` We can get benefit from this project for checking the status of our pipelines. I
have an issue with gemini when I containerized this project. It gives an authentication timeout but
I'll work on it. Besides that I was trying different pipelines for detecting different error but I
guess we have some quota and gemini becomes exhausted :cry: .

Message 20 - 2025-07-01 14:26

It's basically an app in Python that take documentation into an embedding database and run a LLM
with a RAG (to access to the doc at that database). They probably deploy it in OpenShift and they'll
connect the bot account in slack with that service. So, the chatbot can answer questions using the
ingested docs. The code looks good, and it's simple but all that you need for that. nice project for
learning, but also for creating our own (or just use it, there nothing specific to konflux there).

I've been asking/investigating how to dump data from slack channels to NotebookLM, and the most
difficult and lengthy process is getting the auth token approved to run the API

we can use the native slack API "retrieving" function, but we still have to get a PIA approval which
can take a long time

Justin Pierce already went through that process and got it approved, you can find more info here

Hi. I've been playing around with local AI agents and MCP servers
(https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) lately and I found this one:
https://block.github.io/goose/ It's open source and it can work with many LLMs, including local
ones. It's similar to Gemini-cli or Claude-code, but it's not tied to just one LLM, and it has other
interesting characteristics, like sessions, projects, and more. It looks very easy to extend and it
has this interesting feature for using different models in turns in the same session:
https://block.github.io/goose/docs/tutorials/lead-worker
I have't used it much yet. Just tried a bit. The UI is not so nice as claude-code or gemni-cli, but
it has potential. We'll see.

Another open source AI agent I came across recently is https://opencode.ai/ I heard good things, but
i haven't tried it yet. It can run multiple agents in parallel in the same session, which looks
useful (or messy :thinking_face: ) and suppose to be very fast.

Hi there :redhat_cowboy: Coming out of short Q3 innovation days at the ISR office about AI and MCP
and wanted to shre: 1. AI/Agents/MCP intresting slides.
(https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1VRO2xxv3BPra4ixy7kDm5p4FVGYoqqfTns6GJ6mP30Y/edit?slide=id.g36b7eb1a849_0_3295#slide=id.g36b7eb1a849_0_3295)
2. Very interesting MCP registry (https://github.com/redhat-ai-tools)with all kinds of goodies(as
Slack MCP, Jira MCP etc ...) that would make your work easier by leveraging on them or adding your
own MCP project there.

In case anyone is interested on understanding a bit better some of the basic concepts about
generative AI, how LLMs work, RAG, agents and other AI related topics, I curated a YouTuve list with
good quality (and short) explanations. FYI, the videos have a logical and incremental order, so I
recommend to follow it, but you can do as you wish :sweat_smile:

it up here to share further :meow_smilesweat: Didi shared this to us in a FoA meeting and it is very

Following the "behind the curtin" trend, here is a code example I did to understand how the "tool
calling" (which later was used for the MCPs) actually works "under de hood":
https://github.com/juanje/llm-tool-calling/blob/main/pseudo_tool_calling.py
That's with a old model that doesn't support "tool calling", to see what exactly the LLM (and the ai
app) does. Then, they started to train models with thousands of examples for this, so now the models
"understand" what to do when you pass a JSON schema for using a function or a tool. So, now you can
do it "natively" like this:
https://github.com/juanje/llm-tool-calling/blob/main/real_tool_calling.py Here is the high level
explanation and shorter version of the code: https://github.com/juanje/llm-tool-calling

*For learning* Here you have a simple chatbot done with LangChain (a very good and standard lib for
creating chatbots and agents) and Ollama (to work with local models). There you can learn how to
talk with the LLMs and do basic ai app stuff: https://github.com/juanje/simple-chatbot And this is
the same chartbot but with a simple (pssudo)RAG, so you can talk with a knowledge database. It's not
using a tipical vector database, but a simple json file as a "database" for the retrieval part, to
simplify things and focos on how the RAG actually works instead of focusing on the infra part or the
extracting/embedding part. https://github.com/juanje/simple-chatbot-miniRAG

Hi and thanks for adding me to this channel! We are working on a Test Console ChatBot, early stages,
and we are investigating a few things: https://issues.redhat.com/browse/VROOM-32061 The goal is to
have a chat bot able to interact with Test Console data, retrieving information and creating
requests in our system. Due to that we have some questions such as: â€¢ what is the best interface to
share with the ai in terms of tools? direct db access, api, python module, ad hoc â€¢ where to store
the conversation history (in browser, db, not needed) â€¢ we need RAG? (it is enough to describe the
tools or we need additional context?) â€¢ which LLM is better for our us case? (Gemini? we don't need
to ask about the universe! An LLM deployed with Ollama?) Any insight will be useful!

I recommend anyone that's using Cursor, claude-code or any other AI tool for coding to us
https://context7.com/ The LLM often have old knowledge about the libraries, APIs, etc and they can
make the wrong assumptions, put the wrong versions or use deprecated functions. Context7 is an MCP
server that give to the IDE the tools for checking the latest documentation for most of the libs
you'll ever use. As a tip, add also to your cursor rules or your CLAUDE.md files to check with
context7 before creating a new project, add a new library or while debugging errors. The results are
normally much better.
