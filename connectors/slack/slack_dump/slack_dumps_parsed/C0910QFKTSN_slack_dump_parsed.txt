Built to make you extraordinarily productive, Cursor is the best way to code with AI. Title:
Introducing Plan Mode · Cursor If you're using Cursor for creating new projects or features for your
projects, this new feature could be useful. I've just tried and it's looking good. If you normally
as Cursor to create a detailed plan before starting to work, this is similar, but it's more
integrated. It ask you some questions to clarify the goal and constraints and the create a detailer
plan and ToDo. It saves the plan in markdown for future reference or changing stuff. Then you hit
"build" and it start building the project/feature. https://cursor.com/blog/plan-mode

AI-powered code review tool for local changes, GitLab and GitHub. Analyzes local changes or
pull/merge requests and provides intelligent feedback to improve code quality. Title: Red Hat / Edge
/ ci-cd / AI Code Review · GitLab AI-powered code review tool with local Git, remote MR/PR analysis,
and CI integration (GitLab or GitHub) Title: ai-code-review-cli FYI, I published the pip package for
my project ai-code-review (https://gitlab.com/redhat/edge/ci-cd/ai-code-review):
https://pypi.org/project/ai-code-review-cli/ `ai-code-review` was already taken :confused: I also
changed the README to make it more end-user focused. So ppl can use it right away, even locally
(with pipx or using the container) And I added a webpage to explain simply the project and its
features: https://ai-code-review-fd7894.gitlab.io/
I hope you like it. And any feedback is welcome :slightly_smiling_face:
