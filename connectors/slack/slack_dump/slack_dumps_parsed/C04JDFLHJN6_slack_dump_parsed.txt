----------------------------------------
@Juanje Ojeda I ran into this issue today and am not sure how to proceed just yet with debugging it.
See https://issues.redhat.com/browse/VROOM-19327 for some context. Comments on the ticket from today
only. Basically when I build the image expected arm64 functionality is present but the atc built
kernel does not contain it. That ticket is to verify that the functionality does not change between
releases. Thanks!

Hi team, can anybody help moderating the retrospective meeting for today? I can't join because I

Hi does anyone know why we don't have console log support, is there some ticket tracking this work,
it's supported already in Testing Farm.

Another question maybe for @Roni Eliezer where and how are we setting the Polarion test run assignee
? Are you using a static list or fetching from our packages/all repository ?

:rolled_up_newspaper:  *RHIVOS compose is now based on RHEL 9.5* :rolled_up_newspaper:
After a program decision, the current RHIVOS compose will be based on RHEL 9.5 in preparation for
Tech preview. *It starts with the next nightly*. Shortly the RHIVOS pipeline will support parallel
versions and we'll have one for DevPreview UPdates (RHEL 9.4) and Tech preview (RHEL 9.5).

As CentOS Stream 10 is now hitting the mirrors at https://mirror.stream.centos.org/ is it possible
to enable ODCS compose for AutoSD 10 on https://autosd.sig.centos.org/ as well? It would help
getting ready with Automotive SIG there. Is this already planned somewhere in Jira? couldn't find
it.

Hi, it seems like it would help at different levels to have a "latest" link in the nightly images
exposed on https://autosd.sig.centos.org/AutoSD-9/. For example:
https://autosd.sig.centos.org/AutoSD-9/nightly/sample-images/ •
https://autosd.sig.centos.org/AutoSD-9/nightly/sample-images/auto-osbuild-qemu-autosd9-developer-ostree-aarch64-latest.qcow2.xz
->
https://autosd.sig.centos.org/AutoSD-9/nightly/sample-images/auto-osbuild-qemu-autosd9-developer-ostree-aarch64-1374921864.017a82ff.qcow2.xz
•
https://autosd.sig.centos.org/AutoSD-9/nightly/sample-images/auto-osbuild-qemu-autosd9-developer-ostree-x86_64-1374921864.017a82ff.qcow2.xz
•

• and similar for other image types For example, some documentations parses the page and use the
listing order to find the latest name. That isn't nice to read and it has various caveats handled
more or less completely (e.g, listing order reliability)
Would that be something the toolchain team would be able to do?

Hello! So I'm still kind of figuring it out (I was just assigned to the role), but I will be acting
as a consultant for RHIVOS' pipeline from Product Security, specifically around onboarding it into
Konflux, when the time comes. Right now I'm in onboarding mode, trying to learn as much as I can
around RHIVOS' pipeline, so I welcome any resources or recommendations on meetings to attend.
I worked as the security architect for RHIVOS for the past 3 years, so the product isn't new to me,
just the pipeline portion.

Hi everyone, I noticed emails to automotive-a-team this morning w.r.t. this merge request
(https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/certification-assembly/-/merge_requests/150) and
after visiting the MR I noticed this merge request review comment
(https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/certification-assembly/-/merge_requests/150#note_11817871)
from our bot account that looks like a human wrote it. Did we introduce some code review AI or is
someone logged in to Gitlab as the bot account?

Message 30 - 2024-07-22 14:38
From: Michael Ho
----------------------------------------
@Ryan Smith I believe the bot has gained sentience. I am not sure how, or why, but it may relate to
lightning strikes. I think we need to look into this because the quality of code review shows
significant capability and we may have now a new technology to compete with CoPilot.

Message 31 - 2024-07-22 14:39
From: Ryan Smith
----------------------------------------
If it is new AI then that's pretty neat, but if it is someone logged in as the bot account please
log out and log back in as yourself.
@Hubert Stefanski @Kanitha Chim We should probably consider stripping people's permissions to log in
to this account and rotate any tokens.

Message 34 - 2024-07-22 15:06

For real though.. Whoever this is, please log out. We shouldn't be using accounts dedicated for
automation for our own use, we share those credentials through bitwarden in good faith that they
won't be abused (either intentionally or not)

Hi I have logged in to bot account more than a week ago to give it credentials to CA repo by
creating a new token for it with all required permissions on CA. This was done in order to push auto
MRs to the CA repo It might be that while being logged in to bot account for the token creation I
approved by mistake an MR Sorry for the confusion , AI is not so clever yet ...

Message 43 - 2024-07-30 18:06
From: Stephen Smoogen
----------------------------------------
Do you mean in base RHIVOS or in the additional repositories which supplement RHIVOS? The main
differences I know between RHEL and RHIVOS are a couple of packages: 1. kernel-automotive (RT kernel
+ compilation options found useful - a lot of modules we dont want) 2. the gcc and binutils cross
compilers which are built in the RHEL build system out of gcc but only shipped in RHIVOS In the
centos-automotive sig and copr I see about 50 packages which are extras but I don't know which ones
are 'would like to have in autosd someday' and which are 'this is meant to help us but we dont like
it'

:redflag: *RHIVOS nightly not booting (unblocked)* :redflag: _Aug 13th, 2024_ The

(https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-45533). The ticket is complex and is currently being worked
on, but in the meantime we have tagged back that kernel version so that the pipeline and the nightly
were unblocked. This means that *we have a new nightly today*, but *it does not contain the latest
kernel version*, but the previously mentioned one.
Last night *AutoSD* hit the same issue, so we missed last nightly upstream. We'll pin the kernel
version until the bug get fixed, so we can build the nightly again.

A repository to maintain the ATC custom images that can't be maintained at the sample-images repo.
Title: qa.mpp.yml · main · Red Hat / Edge / ci-cd / Pipe X / Custom Images · GitLab @Avihai Efrat
unrelated to S4 really, but when I'm looking at the rpm list, there are still few other rpms that we
pull in from upstream into RHIVOS builds. Through here
(https://gitlab.com/redhat/edge/ci-cd/pipe-x/custom-images/-/blob/main/qa.mpp.yml?ref_type=heads#L36)
it's not a good practice to just enable EPEL fro downstream builds. While we won't be releasing the
"qa" image to customers and it's just for internal use, I do not think we can guarantee the actual
tested content is released in RHIVOS. We should actually validate and fail when we include anything
from upstream - or even better, run the build disconnected only with the compose repos

Hi @Yariv Rachmani ,
Yariv, When you say *'*made qm broken' can you elaborate on what exactly is broken currently and
what/who does it impacts?
*About broader context:* Juanje will know more as he was more involved but I'll try to provide some
context and the plan as described in this ticket https://issues.redhat.com/browse/VROOM-21951 which
is an outcome of the meeting notes here

the outcomes section) with Juanje, Amanda, Mathew and Rachel.
• Outcome section: ◦ We should be testing on an image that is the core RPMs plus the test framework,
including the QM Partition. We should test against a ‘regular’ image (not ostree). ▪︎ We think the
QM image may already meet this criteria but is ostree ▪︎ If possible we want to use this in the
practice CTC later this week ▪︎ Once we confirm our image - we should rename it
:slightly_smiling_face: ◦ We should have a validator / test that confirms this is the case. ▪︎
https://issues.redhat.com/browse/VROOM-21952 ◦ There may be some tests that require a custom image
setup. This can be handled on a case-by-case basis. ◦ Juanje Ojeda (mailto:juanje@redhat.com) will
own updating the QA image. ▪︎ https://issues.redhat.com/browse/VROOM-21951

I don’t believe capacity is an issue but with boards becoming disabled I’d expect more problems.
Some tests run longer than others. There are timings in test console .ctc file. I was suggesting
borrowing boards to get us back to normal operational capacity of 6 boards while I troubleshoot
shoot the 2 disabled boards. I will need a short 10 minute window to do that on Thursday morning.

be `RHIVOS-1.0-MixedCriticality` rather than `Mixed_Criticality`

Another ride4 board, ride4-16 has been marked disabled in the pool overnight. This means we have 5
working boards in the pool. I will create a spike ticket for this as it is likely to impact mixed

analysis. cc @Avihai Efrat @Roni Eliezer

@Ozan Unsal I must say I stumbled upon the convoluted parsing and substitutions of AMI file in TC
....it's quite horrible indeed. I wonder why it needs to be complicated. What's wrong with a
directory structure? Why do we need a file at all? just use a date and sequence for multiple runs
within a day and it's perfect (e.g. like RHEL's RHEL-8.6.0-20240815.4) and that's it. Who needs

We generally run a PCP container to collect host system metrics under load. In a "default" (Fedora
specifically here) podman config, this works fine because the container by default has access to the
host kernel file systems, and we run with host networking as well. I'm getting the impression on
newer runs on RHIVOS/AutoSD that our PCP container does not in fact have access to the host system
metrics. Anyone know if we are explicitly isolating namespaces in this way with the podman config?

Hello team and happy Tuesday! I hope you enjoyed the long weekend for those on public holiday
yesterday :sunglasses:
ATC weekly team meeting time moved +1 hour for this week only as it conflicted with program call
most likely due to day light savings changes in Europe (Oct27)but not in US yet (Nov3).
Another kind ask: Focus area leads to please add your ATC weekly updates to the ATC sum up doc so we
can be more prepared to share them on the program call (usually this ask is done in the weekly
meeting followed by the program call but this week the order is reversed:)) @Juanje Ojeda @Robert

@Pavol Brilla could you please take a look tomorrow morning if @Rachel Sibleydoesn't have any magic
answers today? It is really *concerning* that people do not really test things before making
impactful changes. It really does affect a lot of people right now
AFAICT the S4 images from ATC will still *not* work as of today/tomorrow. The autoinit partition
correction has not been merged (MR135 on a-i-b. today there was "only" a fix for broken qemu target)

is there still anybody from ATC around? I really wonder...if we want to have some S4 image working

Message 302 - 2024-11-19 18:35
From: Michal Skrivanek
----------------------------------------
...because the alternative is that somebody merges Ed's MR (which would be obsoleted by alex's work
from today), bumps sample images, and then anyway we'll have a lot smaller /var that likely wont' be
sufficient for kernel(at least) so it's not really going to be the end of these fixes.

The downstream (rhivos) pipeline is broken right now. Too many different issues between yesterday
and today :confused: We've been fixing stuff, but still we couldn't get last night pipeline to
finish the builds :confused: Also, most of the ATC team is already gone, so no ppl around for
approving MRs. So, I don't thing we can do that revert now. I'm not even sure we need to. I still
see too many contradictory opinions around that topic. I'll wait to see what we decide tomorrow on
the readiness meeting. We still need to wait for the exception about bluechi before rebuilding the
release.

From: Jaime Flynn
----------------------------------------
@Michal Skrivanek, can you summarize your recommendation? Are you suggesting we need to both revert
the /var change and wait for Ed's MR? I know we are just trying to get a build working for CTC, but
randomly making changes after Dev Freeze is not helping us. We have a blocker/exception process that
we should be leveraging to have cross-functional discussions about the changes that need to happen
to the build. It sounds like discussion is needed if there are contradictory opinions. Let's have a
daily meeting, if needed. With conversations happening in so many channels, it is hard to keep up.

Message 309 - 2024-11-19 19:23
From: Jaime Flynn
----------------------------------------
With regard to the exception for bluechi, I'd argue that this is something that could wait if it
slows us down in getting a working build for CTC.

Hi team, did we also change the latest builds to be read only on `/usr` ? I installed
RHIVOS-1.0-TechPreview-202411041507 and after running tmt I see the following error: `mv: cannot
remove '/usr/lib/systemd/coredump.conf.d/10-automotive.conf': Read-only file system` Some tests rely
on this being updated or temporarily removed because it blocks the creation of core dumps. Is there
a build key to turn this off? Is it only on the qa images or also on the developer images? This was
a ridesx4 image that i used.

happening with those boards and the jobs never end. We have been having many different issues this

if it doesn't smoke-test those ridesx4 images...

Just wanted to get thoughts an discuss shared pool usage of Rcar4 boards for on-boarding from CKI
(as its been discussed in the past, due to the extremely difficult nature of the rcar flashing
implementation) that there should only be one pool. Now that we are using tf-requests module, it
would indeed make sense to consolidate resources allowing for a more simple and generalized
implementation in CKI infra also.
The one issue I see is the expectation of no other triggering in "CTC" where CKI will still trigger
against the pool. Also I see no reason to not consolidate the ridesx4 cki resources to one shared
pool also.

Hi !channel, are you going to join the Edge End-of-Year- Celebration which includes Automotive
today? It is at the same time as your ATC weekly team meeting. Please let me know, if I should
cancel the team meeting from the calendar in favor of the End -of-Year- Celebration.

Hi @Sabine Vogel, We have some critical issues (tech preview related) to discuss at today's ATC
weekly meeting and with all hands and release readiness other meeting frenzy this is more important
to attend as much as I would love to go to Edge End-of-Year- Celebration. Please do not cancel the
ATC weekly meeting.

Question, was there a new release strategy for RHIVOS images? I see TechPreview-Update is now gone
and there are newer TechPreview builds. I was under the assumption TechPreview was done a while ago

Sorry, I need to send an email about this. I haven't had time yet :see_no_evil: But yest, we removed
the `TechPreview-Update`, which was a copy from `latest-RHIVOS-1`. It was causing some confusion, so
we remove them. I'll explain better in the email. The changes in the `TechPreview` release are
because we need to re-spin the release due some exceptions (updated version for BlueChi and the
Automotive packages added to the compose). We saved the previous TechPreview as RC1 and we're
rebuilding it weekly, preparing for the final version on Dec 19, so we can use it for the FuSa
Submission in Feb, but which tests starting in Jan.

:announcement: Hi all!
To optimize time and resources, we are planning to remove unnecessary builds from the AutoToolchain
product build pipeline. I have compiled a list
(https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WkUrT8S4h7orbv2ckwJVxKBsLWhOep42QeZXeq6z4n0/edit?usp=sharing)
of all builds currently included in the pipeline. Items marked in red are proposed for removal,
meaning the corresponding images will no longer be available. Please review the list to confirm that
the images marked for removal are not in use and ensure their exclusion will not impact your work.
Your feedback is crucial in finalizing these changes. Thank you for your cooperation!

Message 375 - 2024-12-12 12:41

@Ozan Unsal I don't understand the upstream/downstream distinction there. Can you explain?

Message 376 - 2024-12-12 14:05
From: Juanje Ojeda
----------------------------------------
:announcement: We have a small change coming in the image names. For historic reasons, we have
`rhivos9` in the image file name:
`auto-osbuild-qemu-rhivos9-qm-minimal-ostree-aarch64-10238830.9e7b0910` But that `9` (originally a
reference to rhel9 as a base for the release) is wrong and confusing. We're going to remove that
release number, to avoid confusions. We can still see the distro it's based on at the info.txt
(https://rhivos.auto-toolchain.redhat.com/in-vehicle-os-9/RHIVOS-1/latest-RHIVOS-1/info.txt) file:
```Upstream distro: rhel-9.6``` And inside the image and the `/etc/os-release` inside the image
still shows the RHEL version. This change shouldn't break anything as now the expected way for
getting the images name is the new test_images_info.json
(https://rhivos.auto-toolchain.redhat.com/in-vehicle-os-9/RHIVOS-1/latest-RHIVOS-1/test_images_info.json)
file.

Hi !channel, :tada::sparkles: Celebrating *Five Years of Hubert Magic!* :sparkles::tada: Let’s fire
up the celebration engine because today we’re marking _five incredible years_ of brilliance,
dedication, and just downright awesomeness from the one and only *Hubert*! :partying_face: It all
started on January 13, 2020, when Hubert joined Red Hat as a bright-eyed intern in Cloud
Services—and let me tell you, he didn’t just "join"; he _blasted off_! :rocket: Fast-forward a mere
1.5 years, and he was already a core part of the RHIVOS family and the ToolChain team, where the
real magic began. :dizzy:
*Now, five years in, the highlights are almost too many to count* (but I'll try): :sparkles: Nearly
finishing a master’s degree in Enterprise Software Systems (with a dissertation tackling QNX agents
for BlueChi like a boss). :sparkles: Launching a side business _developing platforms_ (because why
not conquer the world, right?). :sparkles: Crushing it as a Senior Software Engineer with major
contributions to RHIVOS infra and gating—as a leader, designer, mentor, and all-around rockstar.
:sparkles: Driving collaboration across products and teams like a pro. :sparkles: Oh, and just
casually filing multiple patents because innovation runs through his veins.
Hubert, your professionalism, collaboration, and _next-level problem-solving wizardry_ make you an
absolute legend. Your colleagues (all of us, obviously) think the world of you—and you inspire us
every single day to aim higher and dream bigger. :rocket: We’re beyond lucky to have you on this
team, and we can’t wait to see what kind of amazingness you’ll unleash over the next five years
(_spoiler alert: at Red Hat, of course!_) :smile:
Here’s to you, Hubert—congratulations on this epic milestone! :clinking_glasses::tada: You’re the
definition of a superstar, and we’re celebrating _you_ today! Let’s give him all the cheers, love,
and virtual high-fives, team! :clap::raised_hands:

activation state, i.e. generalization of SUB. SUB = The low-level unit activation state, values

Hi all, I have seen a request that has a provisioning failure yesterday: `"message": "failed to

The image used was:

If it's known, that great. If not, maybe there is some regression.

From: Arik Hadas Title: Testing RHIVOS on OpenShift tl;dr two MRs were posted for test-console for
things we've noticed while working on a demo where TC talks with OpenShift
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2Ro7aBfIUw)
hi! yesterday we've presented the above mentioned demo in the gathering that takes place in
Barcelona
for that, we needed to change the endpoint of testing farm that is currently hard-coded in TC, hence
this MR (https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/services/test-console/-/merge_requests/246)
we've also noticed that it takes long to build the container image of TC when making code changes,
hence this MR (https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/services/test-console/-/merge_requests/245)
the task of generating a repot then failed, we've solved it by adding `RUN chmod 777 /test-console`
to the Containerfile (as that's where the `_config.json` was written) but you may want to tackle it
differently..
your review of these MRs and in general, engagement in this effort would be appreciated!

Hi Team,
I recently discovered that the devel package has been added to the images and so when some tests
that need it run, it registers as being installed, however the src that comes with the devel package
is missing so the following error occurs when trying to build modules for test. ```09:18:23 out:
Package kernel-automotive-devel-5.14.0-522.471.el9iv.aarch64 is already installed. ... 09:18:28 out:
make -C /lib/modules/5.14.0-522.471.el9iv.aarch64/build M=/var/tmp/stackman modules^M 09:18:28 out:

2^M``` When did this change take place? This was puzzling becaus eit works on the debug image but i
see that on debug it is not on the image so the test has to insall it which gets all the right bits
onto the system. However you are adding this to the non debug kernel it is missing the full install
needed to build. cc: @Troy Dawson @Juanje Ojeda

:redflag:RHIVOS pipeline broken :redflag: During the weekend the Downstream pipeline has been broken
and we haven't able to build a new compose or images since Thursday night.
The problem seems to be a dependency (`libselinux`) that was updated upstream, but not downstream.
So, AutoSD has all the right versions and can build, but it looks like RHEL didn't updated that
package, so all the packages that depended on it fail to install. The problem should be fixed once
RHEL fix the dependencies. In the mean time, @Ozan Unsal is trying to pin the previous working
version, so we can build the compose and images.
We'll let you know when we have more news.

So, not really a RHEL dependency issue, but a RHIVOS gating issue. Gator failed to gate a few
packages on Friday due to a bug and `libselinux` was one of them. The bug was fixed and now the
gating is running. We should have the correct version soon in the compose and the pipeline working
again soon :pray:

----------------------------------------
When we started to do the re-spins, we override the TechPreview release. As you well know, it didn't
go so well... So, we started to create RC for that. To avoid breaking links in polarion for results,
we left the last TechPreview that we override with the same name/path.
So, the final TechPreview RC we built successfully is RC4.
*RHIVOS-1.0-TechPreview-RC4 -&gt; The newest and final one.*
I'd like to point TechPreview to RC4, but we need to think about how to do that without breaking
links in polarion or anything else.
BTW, yes, we're fixing our release workflows to avoid this mess in the future.

Hi folks,
I would like to start a discussion to add a new parameter in the `test_images_info.json` file. I
would like to add a new variable with the `COMPOSE_ID`, I know this information in a file call
`COMPOSE_ID` (example:
https://rhivos.auto-toolchain.redhat.com/in-vehicle-os-9/RHIVOS-1/latest-RHIVOS-1/repos/RHIVOS/COMPOSE_ID)
and inside of the `rpms.json`file
(https://rhivos.auto-toolchain.redhat.com/in-vehicle-os-9/RHIVOS-1/latest-RHIVOS-1/repos/RHIVOS/compose/metadata/rpms.json),
but I don't want to get from those files.
I want to add it, and create a simple function or extend in
https://gitlab.com/redhat/edge/ci-cd/pipe-x/tf-requests/-/blob/main/src/tf_requests/get_auto_compose.py.
This file contains the logic to get the testing farm pool and the raw string with the compose, but
we can't get the compose id, and get directly any file (`COMPOSE_ID` or `rpms.json`), but it breaks
all the magic of the previous script and that script speaks about compose information.
Reviewing repositories (5 minutes), MR's must be done in:
• https://gitlab.com/redhat/edge/ci-cd/pipe-x/tf-requests •
https://gitlab.com/redhat/edge/ci-cd/pipe-x/image-info-generator I don't know where it must be set
in your pipelines when the images is created.

Hi team, I just completed a build using the qa image for ridesx4 and noticed that the image size is
5G. ```[root@localhost ~]# df -h . Filesystem Size Used Avail Use% Mounted on /dev/sde38 4.9G 2.7G
2.0G 58% / [root@localhost ~]#``` I see there was a change 2 days ago to make this limit. But there
is no `pi_resize` delivered to grow the partition. So this breaks the ridesx4 board for most kernel
testing. If `pi_resize` is not working on boot for the ridesx boards can we add a condition to the
`qa.mpp.yml` to set the `image_size` to `17179824128` for the ridesx4 boards? This is the size set
in the defauts for ridesx4 but this change overrides the default. Thanks! cc: @Troy Dawson

I guess it has to do with the fact that the image was build with one nightly compose, and now the
nightly compose is different, so the dnf database cache has the wrong index or something. But I
thought the dnf cache was empty in a fresh new image :thinking_face:

I have a test which verifies the running image - We were using the url, but i see on AutoSD this is
no longer the case, - where build info now lists a more specific release example:
`autosd9-202503190201` is this expected?

:red_ball: Today's nightly build has an important and possible breaking change: we added the new
`redhat-release-automotive` package. :red_ball: Because that package change the files
`/etc/os-release` and `/etc/redhat-release` to state that the release is `rhivos` instead of `rhel`,
it might break some tests. Please, if you see any weird behaviors in your tests, report them here.
We're building a new `latest` without that change, so it doesn't break anything else. I'll be

GitLab CI pipelines Title: .gitlab/containers.yml · main · Red Hat / Edge / ci-cd / Pipe X /
pipelines-as-code · GitLab Hi toolchain, it seems the "docker" runners are now gone in gitlab cee :)
and we're meant to use the "shared-podman" runners now. But in the container-build job hosted in
pipe-x
(https://gitlab.com/redhat/edge/ci-cd/pipe-x/pipelines-as-code/-/blob/main/.gitlab/containers.yml?ref_type=heads#L28),
I saw now this is hardcoded to the "docker" runners.. Just a heads up, you may find some issues
having hardcoded tags into the jobs to make them reusable in both gitlab.com (http://gitlab.com) and
gitlab cee now. You'll probably need to create an override version of the container-build job in
downstream that fixes the tag, or remove the tags from the jobs..

HI @Nisha Saini, On today's ATC weekly meeting, we discussed about ESS and SOA deadlines and I want
to have the team to have full clarity as we are close to the deadline and GA about what needs to be
done and when.
AFAIK this is the timeline: ◦ July 2025 - Production Launch
(https://pp.engineering.redhat.com/rhivos-1.0/schedule/tasks/#red_hat_in_vehicle_operating_system_1_0.launch_phase)
for 1.0GA ◦ PSSC only starts the SOA process upto 45 days before the release date (in our case May
2025) ◦ *We need to get all services ESS reviewed by April 30th*
1. Can you have a brief look on the state of things on the EPIC
(https://issues.redhat.com/browse/VROOM-24606) or Sheet
(https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1J6KqIrTH5aLMhsHKJrXlIm-MfPV_NZgG-ldaSAs0IDQ/edit) and point
to what needs to be completed by April30 and who should do it? 2. What happens if we do not get ESS
reviewed by April30, how does that effect 1.0 GA? 3. WHat does ESS reviewed by April 30 means ? just
to have the attestation info filled or an actual change/fix? 4. What happens after April 30 till GA
(July) on the SOA level until we reach GA, where can we see this work?

write out a `BOOT_TYPE` line. (my preference). If ukiboot is not used, then what should the default

Hi All, This is follow up on what we discussed in y'day's meeting: We are almost reaching the end of
remediation tasks due date for "VHCL-012 Authorization &amp; Authentication". Out of the 2 options
that we have: a) Extend the remediation tasks to be compliant for these controls b) Get permanent
exception.
As we don't plan to work on remediation anytime soon because of GA &amp; issues which will be caused
by extra auth layer we decided to go with option(b) @Juanje Ojeda @Kanitha Chim@Avihai Efrat @Paul
Caramuto: As permanent exception will go through Infosec VP approval we need to provide as much

using it, because he use to mirror the nightlies, but I don't think he needs to do it anymore, as we
have the monthlies and the CDN is so much faster for downloading. What I don't know is if any of our

No, `rhivos-1.0.0` will remain unchanged forever. Updates to that release will be landing in

@Francisco da Rocha You might be mixing a number of things here.
• `rhivos-1.0`, `rhivos-1.0.z`, `rhivos-1.0.1`, `rhivos-1.0.2`, `rhivos-1.0.3` are Jira releases and
really only exist there • from product release perspective (in Errata Tool), there are two
"products" per Y-stream release: `RHIVOS-1.0.0` and `RHIVOS-1.0.0-Z` • in Brew structures,
everything maps to the two "products" above, with tag prefixed with `rhivos-1.0.0` and
`rhivos-1.0.0-z` respectively (e.g. `rhivos-1.0.0-candidate` or `rhivos-1.0.0-z-pesign-build`) • in
dist-git, we have development and stable branches, like `rhivos-1-main`, which always targets the
next Y-stream, and `rhivos-1.0.0`, which is used during the stabilization period (starting when the
underlying RHEL release branches), as well as for all Z updates afterwards The 1.0.1-3 releases in
Jira don't really "exist" as a separate thing, they're scheduled bundles of Z updates. This maps to
the concept of RHEL batch updates. Hope that makes it a bit clearer.

@Kanitha Chim @Marcel Banas I see (https://errata.devel.redhat.com/filter/4300#) you are working
hard to generate the RHIVOS 1.0 errata advisories. Between errata_doc_approver.py
(https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/gnecasov/docs-errata-approver/-/blob/main/errata_doc_approver.py?ref_type=heads),
OSCI's errata-automation (https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/osci/errata-automation), and Toolchain's
gator generate-advisories.yml
(https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/fences/gating/gator/-/blob/main/.gitlab/generate-advisories.yml?ref_type=heads),
I'm trying to figure out where Errata Tool pulls Jira tickets into the advisories, so I can confirm
our RHIVOS errata advisories do not link to any VROOM Jira tickets, per @Petr Sabata's request from
our May 6th Automotive kernel advisories
(https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uOl-XLNwOWwOyvuh20s9qBQCbIx0HV2QwfsI-iXi2mA/edit?tab=t.0#task=wdqgHPzKv-sLT_Hh)
discussion.
I also need to understand what tickets, if any, you're pulling into the RHIVOS advisories for the
RHEL 9.6. I see that you're cloning previously published RHEL 9.6 advisories, @Marcel Banas, and
making advisories for individual RHEL builds that don't already have a RHEL 9.6 advisory. I want to
confirm that the content we have scripted in errata_doc_approver.py is still appropriate for the
methods you're using to generate the RHIVOS 1.0 errata advisories.
Are either or both of you available to meet and coordinate about these questions sometime this week?
If so, send me an invitation. I know we all have a well-earned recharge this week, so I'll do my
best to shuffle meetings to accommodate whatever time you can spare. Thanks!

Hi folks, happy Monday! A kind reminder about Tomorrow(June 10) planned AI hackathon instead of the
usual ATC weekly(using the same time slot) . Please help in adding your latest focus area data
sources[1](docs, slides, markdowns, pictures etc) to this Automotive Toolchain documentation(AI
style) notebook (https://notebooklm.google.com/notebook/8abe43c7-0e34-4fc8-9775-a1e96e96f8e5) =>
CORRECTED THE LINK
In the May 20 ATC weekly mtg, we discussed an interesting option for creating a new joint ToolChain
documentation using notebookLM (https://notebooklm.google.com/) to aggregate our most updated
knowledge per focus area. The plan was to use this 1H meeting to create an initial ATC knowledge
base using notebookLM.
The simplest option to start with this seems like: 1. Manually add all the latest information
sources to this Automotive Toolchain documentation(AI style) notebook
(https://notebooklm.google.com/notebook/8abe43c7-0e34-4fc8-9775-a1e96e96f8e5) I shared with you. 2.
Tomorrow: play around with it in our 1H and refine and see it ready to be shared. 3. Share this
in/out of the team so anyone can ask the AI chatbox in that notebook any Q about anything at ATC can
find it easily and not need to go through different notebooks per focus area. WDYT?
I'm open to suggestions if anything else is more intresting or in the 1H time frame for AI hackathon
to the team or has changed since the May20 meeting. Let me know if you need more time, we can also
push this to next week if it's too tight.
So we have something to explore, can you please help in adding all the latest information sources to
this Automotive Toolchain documentation(AI style) notebook
(https://notebooklm.google.com/notebook/34636dcb-f1e2-4577-bf48-dcf02871e468) ? ( if the data source
can not be added directly to the notebook, please add this in this G-drive
(https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1nPWkU88N6OeFNyVRN0iSU9HqmxnYivJz) and we'll see how to
add it later) It will be helpful to rename the sources so we know what focus area it came from e.g
pipelies/gating/TF_integration/...
Checkout supported data sources and limitations at these nice slides
(https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1TFGmDgqbRCKqxQL3OBjONgJj0FYzhgsR1pqF9bakWEM/edit) for basic

`kernel-automotive-debug` is not a package, but an RPM from `kernel-automotive` builds. Is it

Hi @Pierre-Yves Chibon, @Alex McLeod We're currently testing a change in the RHIVOS/AutoSD compose
structure to enable `hashed_directories` (MR
(https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/rhivos/-/merge_requests/564)). With this change, instead
of all RPMs being placed under a single `Packages/` directory (like we have now
https://rhivos.auto-toolchain.redhat.com/in-vehicle-os-9/RHIVOS-1/latest-RHIVOS-1/repos/RHIVOS/compose/RHIVOS/aarch64/os/Packages/),
they will now be grouped into subdirectories based on their names (e.g., `a/`, `b/`,
https://download-01.beak-001.prod.iad2.dc.redhat.com/odcs/prod/odcs-4239707/compose/RHIVOS/aarch64/os/Packages/).
From what we've observed so far, product build pipelines are functioning correctly with this updated
structure. However, before moving forward, I wanted to check if this change might impact any
documentation, or have any implications for customers or the community that we should be aware of.
Appreciate your input on this!

Another question for you all: I am trying to determine the root cause of this type of failure
(https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/downstream-pipelines-as-code/-/jobs/36060291) on
the contcert-tcl job, as this was the same error reported in the RHIVOS-1.0.0-RC3
(https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/downstream-pipelines-as-code/-/jobs/35523833)
pipeline.
The only way I've been able to reproduce this panic is by passing a value of `""` for the
environment variable `CTCL_AWS_REGION`, which in the pipeline definition
(https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/downstream-pipelines-as-code/-/blame/main/.gitlab/extends.yml?ref_type=heads#L562)
is set like `CTCL_AWS_REGION: "${AWS_CTCL_REGION}"`. So far I have no way to know how the value for
this variable could have ended up empty given it was previously set to `us-east-1` (it should have
been `eu-west-1` so I corrected that today). If you have any insight you might be able to share I'd
appreciate it.

Hi everyone, do we run package inspection i OSCI with rhivos profiles? I would like to know if in
the "gating"/"package promotion to rhivos" mechanism we run some verification like the following
https://artifacts.osci.redhat.com/testing-farm/25f3f4c1-27cf-444d-be6f-af83e9bd9809/ but using
rhivos profile. That because if not, we need to enforce those verifications somewhere

Thanks for adding the new topic to the Open ATC sync meeting @Amanda Sopkin, looks good and thanks

collaborate on, and discuss any Toolchain-related matters. If you could also include the related

Hi, I'm working on VROOM-30999 (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/VROOM-30999) and need to create a
validator that executes a tool and checks/compares the generated reports. The tool needs to be
executed for each nvr in the core-rpm and takes several hours to run. IMO, we should separate the
script from the validator. The script will run independently somewhere and save the results, while
the validator only checks those results. Is it feasible to host it as part of the product-build?

1. Eventually, potentially. There are some blocking open questions stopping us from linking AutoSD
package repos to those of RHIVOS. 2. Most likely not that one specific Distrobaker; to make it more
confusing, the OSCI team broke it down into several smaller derived services and kept using the
distrobaker account name, but they're not running the linked code; that one is kind of obsolete, I
believe.

Hi, I'm trying to build a package mode image with tuneD realtime profile enabled, in the past I was
able to do this by setting `use_tuned_realtime: true` in rcar_s4.ipp.yml file I'm using AutoSD build
from Jun 1st, if I run the commands from: `container_build_command.log build_command.log` the tuneD
profile doesn't get enabled and the corresponding packages are not installed. When I run
`automotive-image-builder` with the parameters from build_command.log, it works. How can I get it
working with the containerized scripts?

:rocket: *[UPDATE] AutoSD &amp; RHIVOS-1 Nightly Builds Are Back!* We’re happy to share that after a
long period of downtime, *AutoSD (https://autosd.sig.centos.org/AutoSD-9/nightly/)* and *RHIVOS-1
(https://rhivos.auto-toolchain.redhat.com/in-vehicle-os-9/RHIVOS-1/latest-RHIVOS-1/) nightly builds*
are now available again. You can resume using the latest builds as usual. Apologies for the
inconvenience, and thanks for your patience!

Message 855 - 2025-07-23 10:47
From: Robert O'Brien
----------------------------------------
In relation to the nightly job failing in past week, does it make sense to now review the smoke test
job timeout and retries? There are 3 retries, and a 4 hour timeout on the smoke test. One of the
nightly jobs took 16 hours to run and then report issue, during the TF outage. That delays the alert
and then responding to a problem. For the smoke test, in the past, we did not limit how many TC jobs
could run in the pool, so smoke test could fail if no board was available to run a job. This took 12
hours for retry and timeout combination.
I can add a ticket to monitoring epic to investigate how to display the pipeline duration on the
dashboard, and compare the 2 streams.

GitLab.com (http://GitLab.com) Title: src/tf_requests/get_auto_compose.py · main · Red Hat / Edge /
ci-cd / Pipe X / Testing Farm Requests · GitLab Hey Toolchain team
Wondering about this function from get_auto_compose:
https://gitlab.com/redhat/edge/ci-cd/pipe-x/tf-requests/-/blob/main/src/tf_requests/get_auto_compose.py?ref_type=heads#L52
We are trying to use the helper to get a image name for latest QEMU to integrate into test pipelines
which would then make the call to Testing Farm to provision the VM, but it seams that this function
is specifically designed only for other use, by these variable being required `aws_regions =
[os.environ.get("AWS_TF_REGION"), os.environ.get("AWS_CKI_REGION")]` Is there a way we could patch
this to just provide universally the image name requested?
Or am I not calling something properly? ```get_automotive_tf_compose --arch aarch64
--webserver-releases http://rhivos.auto-toolchain.redhat.com/in-vehicle-os-9/RHIVOS-1 --release

Working with https://issues.redhat.com/browse/VROOM-28281 looks like we found a different issue, I
suspect that the problem now is not related to the bootloader but with the rhivos-1 image (as the
autosd9 image just works). There is a place where I can see the packages versions used for both,
rhivos-1 and autosd images?

@Hubert Stefanski not for today, but now that the ATC dashboard is running again, the gitlab
pipelines for autosd and rhivos are blank, which is where those `401 Unauthorizeed` messages were
coming from earlier. I'm not sure when the tokens were generated, I'm guessing Michael did that in
the ye olden times, in early 2024. So I think we need new tokens for dashboard, that are not user
tokens. EDIT: local container with my personal tokens work, and get gitlab metrics Can I sync up on

Hi all, Recently we have been instructed by IT to secure our IAM configuration on AWS. This entails
using SSO login to AWS accounts from the command line, removing and not creating 'personal' AWS
users for associates, and rolling service account credentials yearly. To be able to enforce these
policies I have removed associates from the `admin` roles of the three ATC accounts
`aws-ateam-stage` `aws-internal-ateam` and `aws-ateam`. These associates have full permissions to do
anything besides IAM actions in these accounts via the `poweruser` role to which they are assigned
via the corresponding rover groups `it-cloud-aws-&lt;account_number&gt;-poweruser` . If anybody is
not on the poweruser group and needs to be please LMK and I will add you. Thanks and sorry for the
late notification. P.S. to set up SSO access to AWS via the command line please see this page

don't think is good experience for GA, especially when it has issue, I am not sure where exactly to

:rotating_light: *Heads up: Migration Notice: Renaming in-vehicle-os-9 to in-vehicle-os*
:rotating_light:
As part of the enablement work for RHIVOS-2, we will be updating the S3 bucket path currently used
in the Toolchain portal: https://rhivos.auto-toolchain.redhat.com/
*What is changing?* • The existing directory *`in-vehicle-os-9`* will be renamed to
*`in-vehicle-os`*. ◦ Before: https://rhivos.auto-toolchain.redhat.com/in-vehicle-os-9/ ◦ *After*:
https://rhivos.auto-toolchain.redhat.com/*in-vehicle-os/* • This change is needed to ensure that
RHIVOS-2 builds can be populated in the same directory alongside RHIVOS-1 builds. • All services and
components that reference *`in-vehicle-os-9`* must be updated to reference *`in-vehicle-os`* to
avoid broken dependencies. *Impact:* • If your repositories or scripts hardcode the path
*`in-vehicle-os-9`*, you will need to update them. • Starting *early next week*, we are going to
support both *`in-vehicle-os-9`* and *`in-vehicle-os`* but later *`in-vehicle-os-9`* will be
deprecated and no longer maintained. *Action Required:* • Please review your repositories and adjust
any references to use *`in-vehicle-os`* instead of *`in-vehicle-os-9`* before the deprecation date.
*Why this change?* This update standardizes the naming convention and ensures RHIVOS-2 builds are
aligned under a unified *`in-vehicle-os`* directory with RHIVOS-1. Thank you for making the
necessary adjustments. If you have any questions or concerns, please reach out via this thread or in
the #C04JDFLHJN6| channel.

approximately five minutes. During this time the service might be slower than usual or unavailable.
A separate notification will be sent once the maintenance is over. Sorry for the inconvenience. In

Hey @Luigi Pellecchia, I notice we don't upload the results.xml

file from test runs into the toolchain s3 bucket. This file would let us (FoA) discover and access
some files that are arbitrarily named (eg. console-f1dd12da-ce1a-4bb7-a7f6-1d6f7b69d396.log
(https://artifacts.osci.redhat.com/testing-farm/842db3c7-7ad7-460f-926a-35b5edac6f5d/work-planyk_1qku8/console-f1dd12da-ce1a-4bb7-a7f6-1d6f7b69d396.log)).
that we need for validation purposes. Would we need to change something in test-console to get this
file uploaded too or is this upload happening elsewhere?
