[2025-09-11T10:09:47.333589] U04KLL3QSF4: Thank you <@U064YNKHH43> for the detailed answer :thanks-ty:
Yes, this addresses our concerns, we wanted to make sure if these points needed some action to fix from Toolchain team prior to GA.
[2025-09-11T09:21:12.939669] U064YNKHH43: &gt; 1. Will the now-unused 9Base-RHIVOS-1.0.0 variant, which still exists in ComposeDB from the initial import error, cause any future problems for shipping or reporting? Should we take action to clean it up?
It won't cause problem for shipping and reporting externally, Errata Tool will only pick the Compose Variant it mapped(*9Base-RHIVOS*) and carry over the data to Distribution
Like in different RHEL phase(EUS-&gt;AUS), the builds are built for most of the variants, but the supported variants get less and less, Errata Tool only passed supported content of those variants to Distribution repos. So those dup variant's data can be left in composeDB, <@U04JJADSWGM> Please correct me if I am wrong.

&gt; 2. Regarding the CDN repositories, could you help us understand why the Errata Tool is not displaying the complete and correct set of repositories for the `1.0.0` and Z-stream releases, despite what appears to be the correct configuration?
<https://errata.engineering.redhat.com/product_versions/2442#cdn_repos_tab> should show all the cdn links that product version has, either directly or indirectly. e.g. there are some repos created for 1.0.0 and now attached to 1.0.Z, those repos are indirectly repos.
&gt; For Z-stream, we are able to see <https://errata.engineering.redhat.com/product_versions/2442/cdn_repos|only 6 repositories> - only `rhivos-one` .
If you switch to the last tab, you will see there are 6 more repos.
Every erratum has a content tab, once the build is attached. e.g. <https://errata.devel.redhat.com/errata/content/149556>, it will show what rpm will be shipped to where.
Hopefully this address your concerns.

[2025-09-10T20:25:51.393459] U04N9LTR47M: <@U064YNKHH43> <@U04JJADSWGM>, thank you for helping us fix our previous advisory issue. Looks like Marcel has some follow-up questions:
[2025-09-10T12:12:07.891159] U04KLL3QSF4: Hello <@U04JJADSWGM> <@U064YNKHH43>,
we wanted to ask about recently <https://redhat-internal.slack.com/archives/C064MPL86N6/p1753789320313099?thread_ts=1753787090.090569&amp;cid=C064MPL86N6|discussed> product variants for RHIVOS-1.0.0. As of now, the variant's name for 1.0.0 version should be, as defined <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/rhelwfautomation/product-configure-tool/-/blob/master/release_vars/rhivos/RHIVOS-1.0.0.yml?ref_type=heads#L31|here>, `9Base-RHIVOS` , which also <https://errata.engineering.redhat.com/product_versions/2141/variants|shows in ET>. Originally, until the issue regarding block from moving advisories to QE and correcting the variant name, we were running the composedb import command with variant `9Base-RHIVOS-1.0.0` and in ET, packages seem to hence list duplicate of rpms under two variants in product listings (as Kanitha <https://errata.engineering.redhat.com/release_engineering/product_listings?rp%5Bnvr%5D=kernel-automotive-5.14.0-570.518.16.1.16.el9_6iv&amp;rp%5Brelease_version_id%5D=2141|discovered>).
Could this potentially cause some issues?

We also wanted to ask another ET related question - currently, we should have structure of CDN repositories for 1.0 version as follows:
*in CDN*:
• rhivos1/1/
• rhivos1/1.0
• rhivos1/1.1
*names/labels of content-sets to match directories (<https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/sp-pv-mdm/product-service-config-auto/-/blob/main/rhel/rhivos/rhivos-1-for-aarch64.cset.yaml?ref_type=heads#L54|example>):*
rhivos1/1/ == rhivos-one...
rhivos1/1.0 == rhivos-1...
rhivos1/1.1 == rhivos-1_DOT_1

Though in Errata Tool, for RHIVOS 1.0.0 we are able to see only <https://errata.engineering.redhat.com/product_versions/2141/cdn_repos|12 repositories> - without `rhivos-one` .
For Z-stream, we are able to see <https://errata.engineering.redhat.com/product_versions/2442/cdn_repos|only 6 repositories> - only `rhivos-one` .
Even though in config we list all three, `rhivos-1` , `rhivos-one` ,`rhivos-1_DOT_1` as <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/rhelwfautomation/product-configure-tool/-/blob/master/release_vars/rhivos/RHIVOS-1.0.0.yml?ref_type=heads#L58|shown here> (please note the comment on line below, the release values are matching <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/release-definitions/-/tree/main/productids/rhivos-1?ref_type=heads|names of the files in release definition repo>). Could you help us understand this as well please?

Thank you in advance.
[2025-08-25T08:34:06.670729] U02DXVBD5CP: <@U04JJADSWGM> <@U064YNKHH43> I want to ask about `Rhivos Compose Fusa Gate`. Going forward we will have two types of release. One is Fusa release and the other is QM release. With that QM release will not require `Rhivos Compose Fusa Gate` , can we create a new workflow that won't block moving from `QE` to `REL_PREP` for this QM release?
This is the current workflow <https://errata.engineering.redhat.com/workflow_rules/29> that blocks QE to REL_PREP by `Rhivos Compose Fusa Gate`.
I thought I could use this other workflow for QM release: <https://errata.engineering.redhat.com/workflow_rules/8> but I also see `Rhivos Compose Fusa Gate` in the rule set.
[2025-07-31T10:33:41.590239] U04KLL3QSF4: Hello, I created such a <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iNL6YixiDmY9eyh4HA2I_u7uSvAAYo8cmSK2Ctu3nFI/edit?tab=t.0|document> with last section still open to modification and contribution. Please let me know if I missed some important parts of the current workflow for automotive packages and also some suggestions for end-to-end workflow after `NEW_FILES` state.
[2025-07-29T11:04:50.090569] U04KLL3QSF4: Hello <@U04JJADSWGM> <@U064YNKHH43> I wanted to ask you if you can help us, or know the cause of the `Incomplete brew` files issue that is occurring in couple of our RHIVOS GA advisories that prevents state change from NEW_FILES to QE.
There is 8 <https://errata.engineering.redhat.com/advisory/filters/new?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;authenticity_token=nGz42IBEwGSnCFEwRlS%2BvuOv2IEIhLYdYIk0RUJTGKIBChhnQfzP%2B0uq3r0gfwPvF%2Bt2aI3iqlzXCtygWjxKjA%3D%3D&amp;_method=&amp;errata_filter%5Buser_id%5D=3005864&amp;errata_filter%5Bfilter_params%5D%5Bshow_type_RHBA%5D=1&amp;errata_filter%5Bfilter_params%5D%5Bshow_type_RHEA%5D=1&amp;errata_filter%5Bfilter_params%5D%5Bshow_type_RHSA%5D=1&amp;errata_filter%5Bfilter_params%5D%5Bshow_state_NEW_FILES%5D=1&amp;errata_filter%5Bfilter_params%5D%5Bshow_state_SHIPPED_LIVE%5D=1&amp;errata_filter%5Bfilter_params%5D%5Bbatch%5D%5B%5D=3669&amp;_disregard_batch%5B%5D=3669&amp;errata_filter%5Bfilter_params%5D%5Bsynopsis_text%5D=&amp;errata_filter%5Bfilter_params%5D%5Bembargo_option%5D=&amp;errata_filter%5Bfilter_params%5D%5Btext_only_option%5D=&amp;errata_filter%5Bfilter_params%5D%5Bprerelease_option%5D=&amp;errata_filter%5Bfilter_params%5D%5Bhotfix_option%5D=&amp;errata_filter%5Bfilter_params%5D%5Bgroup_by%5D=none&amp;errata_filter%5Bfilter_params%5D%5Bopen_closed_option%5D=&amp;errata_filter%5Bfilter_params%5D%5Bsort_by_fields%5D%5B%5D=batchblock&amp;errata_filter%5Bfilter_params%5D%5Bsort_by_fields%5D%5B%5D=new&amp;errata_filter%5Bfilter_params%5D%5Boutput_format%5D=standard&amp;errata_filter%5Bfilter_params%5D%5Bpl_cache_option%5D=&amp;errata_filter%5Bfilter_params%5D%5Bpagination_option%5D=20&amp;errata_filter%5Bname%5D=&amp;commit=Apply|advisories> currently that have this issue preventing state change.
Example:
the fusa gcc plugin data advisory reports incomplete brew files and there are no rpms shown in the build - <https://errata.engineering.redhat.com/advisory/149344/builds>
but in the product listings they are visible - <https://errata.engineering.redhat.com/release_engineering/product_listings?rp%5Bnvr%5D=fusa-gcc-plugin-data-0.1.0-2.el9_6iv&amp;rp%5Brelease_version_id%5D=2141|https://errata.engineering.redhat.com/release_engineering/product_listings?rp%5Bnvr%5D=fusa[…]n-data-0.1.0-2.el9_6iv&amp;rp%5Brelease_version_id%5D=2141>
After the reload of files and also reattachment of build affected, the issue still persists.
[2025-07-22T13:38:57.472159] U02DXVBD5CP: No rush, please also create a ticket to capture the workflow and also attaching jira issues even after advisories have been created
[2025-07-22T13:35:52.225449] U04KLL3QSF4: <@U02DXVBD5CP> <@U04NN2GEXLZ> I created the ticket to adjust for kernel's components: <https://issues.redhat.com/browse/VROOM-31403>
[2025-06-23T15:11:34.254359] U02DXVBD5CP: right now it blocks advisories moving from NEW_FILE to QE as expected
[2025-06-23T15:11:00.079109] U02DXVBD5CP: Update: Errata &amp; Greenwave integration is enabled again <https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHELWF-12858>
FYI <@U0171SJF00H> <@U04NHTDFS6P> <@U020YLADEKA> <@U04KLL3QSF4> <@U04N9LTR47M>
[2025-06-09T13:39:36.738639] U02DXVBD5CP: Another topic is the access to see jira issues that are marked as embargoed. Do you know who can get that access or how to request it?
[2025-06-09T08:59:18.529869] U02DXVBD5CP: Hi <@U03DM1LN4UW>
Could you approve or give me and this SA the permission to access embargo? I have created SNOW tickets here
<https://redhat.service-now.com/help?id=rh_ticket&table=sc_req_item&sys_id=eac749c847c26e544d8b409c716d4340>
<https://redhat.service-now.com/help?id=rh_ticket&table=sc_req_item&sys_id=22a98999474aa2184d8b409c716d439d>

I understand that I will need permission from Prodsec
[2025-06-06T07:05:18.385659] U02DXVBD5CP: <@U04KLL3QSF4> FYI ^^
[2025-06-06T07:03:33.895599] U02DXVBD5CP: <@U0171SJF00H> <@U04AXB4GK52> <@U04N9LTR47M> <@U04NHTDFS6P> The greenwave integration in Errata is done and was deployed to Production. Now in every advisory, there is a greenwave tab there. The transition between `NEW_FILE` to `QE` is blocked unless Errata can fetch test results from ResultDB (passed or waived)
<https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHELWF-12562>
[2025-05-21T15:03:34.543939] U04N9LTR47M: btw, (from the release readiness call) I like Steve´s idea of a work-around to run validator to all builds to go through the Errata gating
[2025-05-19T20:06:51.203279] U04N9LTR47M: so from my understanding rhivos_compose_fusa_gate is a requirement for moving to QE. Given that RHIVOS only tests specific (ASIL) builds, what are the exact FuSa requirements driving this gate? And if the gate expects results for all builds in an advisory, is there a documented process for manually overriding or waiving the check for builds that are outside the scope of RHIVOS testing?
[2025-05-19T08:00:16.075289] U020YLADEKA: Thanks for the update <@U02DXVBD5CP>!

Some Q's to follow-up and clarify the implications/impact of what you mentioned:
1. Are we blocked by the issues mentioned, and do you need help with escalating something with ET team ?
2. When do you estimate that we'll have compose level gating working?
3. About next action items, who is doing that and when? Do you/Marcel need assistance?
4. Can you please mention in the next release readiness meeting how we're doing, concerns/blockers.  With B&amp;E phase ending early June5 option , will we be ready with compose level gating via Errata by start/mid/end June? 
5. What is the mitigation in case compose level gating is not working/ready on time - Can we release manually, skipping it?
6. <@U04NN2GEXLZ> <@U04NHTDFS6P>, what is your/program view on compose level gating? we might slip functionality working GA date with the issues mentioned( and the ones we yet not seen)
[2025-05-16T13:44:57.381649] U02DXVBD5CP: cc: <@U04NHTDFS6P> <@U04NN2GEXLZ> <@U020YLADEKA>
[2025-05-16T13:44:36.546919] U02DXVBD5CP: Some action items:
• Clarify the testcase name
• Get the list of builds that we are going to run the test
• Run example tests
• and try to test again to verify it works as expected
[2025-05-16T13:43:06.295659] U02DXVBD5CP: Another issue I'm seeing is for build that doesn't have test result, when I try to move them to next state in Errata. I see the blocker:
<https://errata.stage.engineering.redhat.com/advisory/90321>.
This is not clear to me whether we will be able to move this certain advisory forward once the tests for other builds in the same Errata Release/Batch pass or waived. So I have checked with RHELWF team and created this follow-up ticket: <https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHELWF-12774>
[2025-05-16T13:37:59.646829] U02DXVBD5CP: There is a concern about waiving part <https://waiverdb.stage.engineering.redhat.com/api/v1.0/waivers/new?product_version=rhivos-1.0.0&subject_identifier=kernel-automotive-5.14.0-570.518.9.1.9.el9_6iv&subject_type=brew-build&testcase=rhivos.brew-build.functional-safety.continuous-certification&scenario=|https://waiverdb.stage.engineering.redhat.com/api/v1.0/waivers/new?product_version=rhivos-1.0.0[…]nctional-safety.continuous-certification&scenario=>
because the testcase name `rhivos.brew-build.functional-safety.continuous-certification` doesn't match with the rule here: <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/gating/waiverdb-playbooks/-/blob/be20a9522c8ebdf4f2f5bbe3713491dbf3c6156c/files/stage/permissions.yml#L372>
We will need to pick whether we want to use `rhivos.*` or `rhivos-*`
[2025-05-16T13:34:57.424539] U02DXVBD5CP: I want to give a status update here regarding compose level gating specifically the Errata and Greenwave integration.
Right now in Errata stage, we can see that Errata is trying to fetch test results from resultDB [1] <https://errata.stage.engineering.redhat.com/advisory/90358/test_run/rhivos_compose_fusa_gate>. Since we don't have tests for this build yet, so it's giving us an error of `missing result` which is expected.
[2025-05-14T14:25:13.597529] U03DM1LN4UW: *RHEA-2025:149544-01* has been unblocked. Will keep reviewing the others.
[2025-05-14T07:09:40.462909] U04KLL3QSF4: Hello <@U03DM1LN4UW>,
similarly as with RHIVOS's TechPreview release, for RHIVOS 1.0.0 we have some advisories blocked on security alert due to `rpminspect` flagging. It concerns <https://errata.devel.redhat.com/advisory/filters/new?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;authenticity_token=t10BFTwIJ249Q5SO3G4OCjaCe5OKY6sxxPuDrP3xnpWnAP1MbTRq%2B9B4ceQD5Z1iPKkTupbQFYMdALVFsDa0YQ%3D%3D&amp;_method=&amp;errata_filter%5Buser_id%5D=3005864&amp;errata_filter%5Bfilter_params%5D%5Bshow_type_RHBA%5D=1&amp;errata_filter%5Bfilter_params%5D%5Bshow_type_RHEA%5D=1&amp;errata_filter%5Bfilter_params%5D%5Bshow_type_RHSA%5D=1&amp;errata_filter%5Bfilter_params%5D%5Bshow_state_NEW_FILES%5D=1&amp;errata_filter%5Bfilter_params%5D%5Bshow_state_QE%5D=1&amp;errata_filter%5Bfilter_params%5D%5Bshow_state_REL_PREP%5D=1&amp;errata_filter%5Bfilter_params%5D%5Bshow_state_PUSH_READY%5D=1&amp;errata_filter%5Bfilter_params%5D%5Bshow_state_IN_PUSH%5D=1&amp;errata_filter%5Bfilter_params%5D%5Bshow_state_SHIPPED_LIVE%5D=1&amp;errata_filter%5Bfilter_params%5D%5Bbatch%5D%5B%5D=3669&amp;_disregard_batch%5B%5D=3669&amp;errata_filter%5Bfilter_params%5D%5Bsynopsis_text%5D=&amp;errata_filter%5Bfilter_params%5D%5Bblocking_role%5D%5B%5D=9&amp;errata_filter%5Bfilter_params%5D%5Bembargo_option%5D=&amp;errata_filter%5Bfilter_params%5D%5Btext_only_option%5D=&amp;errata_filter%5Bfilter_params%5D%5Bprerelease_option%5D=&amp;errata_filter%5Bfilter_params%5D%5Bhotfix_option%5D=&amp;errata_filter%5Bfilter_params%5D%5Bgroup_by%5D=none&amp;errata_filter%5Bfilter_params%5D%5Bopen_closed_option%5D=&amp;errata_filter%5Bfilter_params%5D%5Bsort_by_fields%5D%5B%5D=batchblock&amp;errata_filter%5Bfilter_params%5D%5Bsort_by_fields%5D%5B%5D=new&amp;errata_filter%5Bfilter_params%5D%5Boutput_format%5D=standard&amp;errata_filter%5Bfilter_params%5D%5Bpl_cache_option%5D=&amp;errata_filter%5Bfilter_params%5D%5Bpagination_option%5D=20&amp;errata_filter%5Bname%5D=&amp;commit=Apply|6 advisories> (the number should be final as scanning is finished). These are advisories that contain RHEL content.
For some of the advisories prior we've had these blocks resolve based on automatic tickets, but e.g. <https://redhat.service-now.com/help?id=rh_ticket&amp;table=incident&amp;sys_id=1ee2c36c2b6d22581956f2f9ed91bf38|here> I see comment `No action` and closed ticket...
Could you help us unblock these advisories?
[2025-05-12T09:58:05.123669] U02DXVBD5CP: <@U04NN2GEXLZ> works now, some other naming issue
[2025-05-12T09:27:04.562889] U02DXVBD5CP: I'll check with them
[2025-05-12T09:26:50.602309] U02DXVBD5CP: Not sure, maybe RHELWF applied the compose level gating there
they said they deployed it on May 8th
[2025-05-12T09:18:21.360469] U04NN2GEXLZ: What's wrong with it?
[2025-05-12T09:18:18.403749] U04NN2GEXLZ: And it fails... <https://errata.engineering.redhat.com/advisory/148503>
[2025-05-12T09:18:03.045399] U04NN2GEXLZ: Hmm, when I try to move my advisory to QE, I get this error.
[2025-02-05T07:33:51.832869] U04KLL3QSF4: Hello, can someone from TC team take a look at this <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/services/errata-advisory-automation/-/merge_requests/2/diffs|MR>? Thanks in advance
[2025-01-06T14:59:04.550669] U03DM1LN4UW: <@U02DXVBD5CP> I have a little more investigating to do, but it looks like this is going to the incident response team's queue for processing. I'll check with them to see how I can help them move these along. I'll do my best to make these move quickly, but I am not sure if I'll be able to. Do we have a date that we need to have this resolved by? Or is it just, ASAP?

In short, this is happening because rpminspect is flagging a bunch of elfs that haven't been compiled with -fPIC. I remember this being a thing for many RHEL packages and I should be able to clear these up, but I need to communicate with the responsible parties in ProdSec.
[2025-01-06T14:30:16.025239] U02DXVBD5CP: Hi <@U04NN2GEXLZ>
there is a tool - Release Driver that is able to auto releasing advisories of the product when they are in `Push Ready` state. Here is the detail: <https://spaces.redhat.com/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=CLOUDDST&amp;title=Auto-Releasing+Product+Advisories> and <https://spaces.redhat.com/display/RHELDST/Errata+Release+Automation>

WDYT? RHEL and other products are using this. Are you okay with RHIVOS onboarding the tool? It needs product owner approval as well
If you agree, I would also ask <@U04N9LTR47M> to help out with communication with the SP side first before proceeding
[2025-01-06T12:57:01.540129] U02DXVBD5CP: Hi, <@U04QH469ETF> <@U03DM1LN4UW>, we have 3 advisories below that are blocked because of security alert. There are builds inherited from RHEL so I think there should not be any issues. Could you double check and unblock them?
• <https://errata.engineering.redhat.com/advisory/144262>
• <https://errata.engineering.redhat.com/advisory/144248>
• <https://errata.engineering.redhat.com/advisory/144245>
[2024-12-04T07:50:21.682579] U04KLL3QSF4: <@U064YNKHH43> <@U04JJADSWGM> Hello, I wanted to ask, whether there is an option to redirect/send emails about advisory to a different address than the one of  Reporter.
Afaik currently there is an option to request for Errata permissions for individual/service account, though for RHIVOS, when we would create advisories for RHEL related packages we would like to have them sent to a mailing list `<mailto:auto-toolchain-errata@redhat.com|auto-toolchain-errata@redhat.com>`.
Currently when I try to put such email into e.g. `Manager Contact` field when creating advisory, it won't let me due to insufficient permissions.
I wanted to ask if this can be achieved, to have in some fields the email instead of individual or a service account creating advisory.
[2024-12-03T14:00:24.139419] U02DXVBD5CP: <@UKSAK8JRH> any idea why it still can't find the pulp repo <https://pub.stage.devel.redhat.com/pub/task/493331/log/stdout.log>
I think I have it here already: <https://rhsm-pulp.corp.redhat.com/content/beta/rhivos1/0.8/>
[2024-12-02T12:56:54.031599] U02DXVBD5CP: Hi <@U064YNKHH43> <@U04JJADSWGM>
how do I fix the repository mapping in errata?
the tech preview repo should be <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/automotive/pipe-x/release-definitions/-/blob/main/definitions/rhivos-1/rhivos-0.8-beta.yml?ref_type=heads>
but in Errata too it's wrong <https://errata.engineering.redhat.com/product_versions/2316/cdn_repos>

I ran into issue while trying to push to cdn: <https://pub.stage.devel.redhat.com/pub/task/493329/log/stdout.log>
[2024-11-26T09:25:28.659289] U02DXVBD5CP: <@U064YNKHH43> <@U04JJADSWGM> do you by any chance know why some builds in here are signed and some are not? <https://errata.stage.engineering.redhat.com/advisory/90194>
[2024-11-25T09:37:13.542449] U04KLL3QSF4: Hello <@U04JJADSWGM> <@U064YNKHH43> I requested for some roles in staging Errata in this <https://redhat.service-now.com/help?id=rh_ticket&amp;table=sc_req_item&amp;sys_id=bc7ffc11330252d06c59a3570e5c7b8d|ticket> and it seems one of the roles `Advisory Manager`  is in pending, the other were approved but can't be processed until all requests are completed.
Can you help me with that?
Thanks in advance.
[2024-11-20T16:20:57.563309] U02DXVBD5CP: <@U04JJADSWGM> Can I have the following permission in Errata Stage?
• Advisory Manager
• Releng
• Product Configuration Manager
I would like to try to do a release in Errata stage
[2024-11-14T12:46:08.330509] U04JJADSWGM: oh hmm, I can't remember the name, but I know the owner, <@U028BN60UGJ> Hey, Andrew,  do you have any idea about this?
[2024-11-14T12:10:02.976129] U02DXVBD5CP: <@U04JJADSWGM> Could you remind me what the service is that monitors the change of advisory and does the tagging/promoting? I wonder if we need to modify anything else for that to work, for example: when builds should be moved from *-candidate to *-pending ...etc
[2024-11-06T12:20:24.586859] U04JJADSWGM: I believe you are using different pub instance, so you'd better not to trigger the button
[2024-11-06T12:20:05.197499] U04JJADSWGM: Yeah, it will call the pub push-staged and connecting the stage pub
[2024-11-06T09:45:56.809789] U02DXVBD5CP: <@U04JJADSWGM> I have a question, what would happen if I click `push to CDN stage` from errata advisory and later use the pub tool `pub push-staged` to do that for the same set of builds? Just concerned if it will cause any issue
[2024-11-01T14:43:14.508699] U02DXVBD5CP: <@U04KLL3QSF4> rpm is ready to be signed through ET advisory now <https://errata.engineering.redhat.com/advisory/140167/builds>, we can start creating advisory for the rhivos pkgs if we have no luck for manual signing
while we're waiting for the assignees' info for some fields in errata, we can just add our contacts to every field if there is no objection

[2024-10-22T13:16:54.614989] U04QL2XHGP4: Correct.  SIGNSERVER-1452 only dealt with the initial key creation , and the initial ACL granting access to the individuals named and the <http://rpm-sign-auto-toolchain.redhat.com|rpm-sign-auto-toolchain.redhat.com>.

It's a fairly simple task to update the ACLs to give radas premissions, now that the key exists.  However, that request must be driven by a "SIGNSERVER" jira request for tracking purposes..

In this case, the three piecies of info you need to present in the request (<https://spaces.redhat.com/display/PRODSEC/Signing+Server+User+Guide#SigningServerUserGuide-1.1RequestinganACLchange|Requesting an ACL change>) are ...
1.  The key name. Sounds like it will be:  *rhivosrelease*
2. The hosts allowed.  In the case of Radas, it's:    **.<http://rsig-001.prod.iad2.dc.redhat.com|rsig-001.prod.iad2.dc.redhat.com>*
3. The kerberos principal.  In the case of Radas, you're not using an individual's kerberos. It would be:  *<mailto:prod-radas@IPA.REDHAT.COM|prod-radas@IPA.REDHAT.COM>*
I can make that change today, if the request comes in and the radas team has no objections.

[2024-09-25T12:03:33.507809] U02DXVBD5CP: Hi all,
I want to provide an update here:
• For TechPreview, we're thinking to push all the RPMs to CDN directly (which means we won't involve with Errata yet). For us to be able to do this, we need all rpms to be signed. Agreement is to inhert RHEL signed for RHEL packages and use RHIVOS' keys to sign RHIVOS-related rpms such as qm, kernel-automotive and bluechi
• For GA, if I understand correctly, we need to use Errata to release. Right now, we're working to create advisories for RHIVOS-related packages. One challenge now is that, it seems that we can't mix keys in Errata (redhatrelease2 & rhivos key)
The second bullet is what we need to figure out.
Please let me know if my understanding is correct, thanks!

[2024-09-05T11:58:05.961059] U02DXVBD5CP: <@U04QH469ETF> I have started this proposal to look into creating advisory for packages like kernel-automotive, qm, bluechi [1]. I would appreciate your review when you have time

[2024-09-03T01:36:19.136049] U04JJADSWGM: <@U02DXVBD5CP> RADAS does the signing work for RPMs once the build is attached to the advisory, the pub service is doing the signing work  for containers during the push job, the tagging work will run when we trigger the push for rpm in the ET push task, that was the previous logic,  now there is a new service to monitor the advisory change and do the tagging work.

[2024-09-02T13:17:10.500109] U02DXVBD5CP: <@U04JJADSWGM> I want to confirm my understanding that when advisory in QE state - RADAS will automatically sign the rpms. Another thing is that it is possible to set a build to promote from a certain tag to another tag? For example, build that are in `*-candidate` can be promoted to `*-pending`

according to this doc: <https://spaces.redhat.com/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=CATALOG&amp;title=radas+%5BRH-Restricted%5D>
```RADAS signs rpms, containers and other artifact types for the product pipeline. For the most general RPM signing case, it listens on the Unified Message Bus on the errata.activity.status topic for an advisory state change to "QE", then signs all the unsigned builds within the advisory and updates Errata Tool about it```
[2024-03-26T12:58:13.998569] U04N9LTR47M: thanks Kanitha, it should be interesting, prod sec will be there, good to learn about errata advisories also, see you soon

[2024-01-18T19:49:24.197789] U04JV0JBEFM: <@U02DXVBD5CP> to follow up, rpminspect moved from ET to build gating; rpmdiff was basically v1 of gating at Red Hat, and rpminspect replaces it (and it happens much earlier in the process). For a build to reach ET, it will have already been run through rpminspect
[2024-01-18T16:19:13.521469] U0171SJF00H: Are we talking about package or release gating?
[2024-01-18T16:08:40.404919] U03DM1LN4UW: <@U02DXVBD5CP> IMO, for ET we should be signing as soon as possible after the FuSa gating. ET for RHIVOS CVEs would be the primary requirement from us. Until ProdSec has a replacement system that runs independently of ET.
[2024-01-18T14:54:14.115629] U02DXVBD5CP: I'll take a look at the doc
[2024-01-18T14:54:07.131269] U02DXVBD5CP: That's good to know, thanks for sharing!
[2024-01-18T14:35:01.786569] U04JJADSWGM: See <https://docs.engineering.redhat.com/display/Errata/Onboard+new+checkpoint+that+already+have+results+in+greenwave+into+ET>
[2024-01-18T14:33:14.106899] U04JJADSWGM: Since RPMDiff sunset. ET doesn't integrate with RPMInspect, but if the RPMInspect results are on gating service now(resultdb), ET has a standard process to fetch the data and onboarding a new transition blocker check
[2024-01-18T10:08:37.740479] U02DXVBD5CP: Hi <@U03DM1LN4UW> FYI, I'm forwarding discussion with <@U04JJADSWGM> here and maybe you have answers to some questions here:
Right now, ET is not integrating with RPMInspect, the check is supposed to happen before the advisory is created and the build attaching to ET. Do you know what we can use to do that?

For signing strategies, do you perhaps know what ET function that you would like to use?
I'm guessing that we only want to use ET to track the RHIVOS CVE fixes, or are we planning to track other things as well?
[2024-01-03T15:22:17.163269] U04AGQD0K8D: <@U04AGQD0K8D> has joined the channel
[2023-12-06T14:54:04.825119] U02DXVBD5CP: Thanks a lot <@U03DM1LN4UW> for the update. I am looking forward to the official announcement and more detail info on how it works
[2023-12-06T14:40:00.216159] U03DM1LN4UW: I'll make sure to forward on the official announcement, but I wanted to mention it because it may play into the work being done here and unfortunately, I don't have much more that I can share.
[2023-12-06T14:39:23.141269] U03DM1LN4UW: I mentioned this to Steve, but maybe here would have been a better place to communicate this. There are some changes coming to ET (errata tool) w.r.t. ProdSec workflow. Due to the reorganization of ProdSec and the refocusing of energy to be earlier in the development lifecycle, we are pushing over the security validation step for RHSA's to the engineering teams to perform and this will become integrated into ET in the QE phase and will be a blocker.
[2023-12-05T08:30:17.029719] U02DXVBD5CP: Just wanted to update that <@U04JJADSWGM> added permission for our keytab to stage and env prod :smile_meow:
[2023-12-04T21:03:33.938569] U02DXVBD5CP: Just want to confirm from your side that we haven't already requested any so I can proceed
[2023-12-04T21:02:59.385449] U02DXVBD5CP: <@U04JV0JBEFM> Yes I did the kinit with our keytab and got this:
```kinit -V -kt ~/.ssh/auto-toolchain-service-errata.keytab auto-toolchain-service-errata@IPA.REDHAT.COM
Using existing cache: 1000:64834
Using principal: auto-toolchain-service-errata@IPA.REDHAT.COM
Using keytab: /home/kchim/.ssh/auto-toolchain-service-errata.keytab
Authenticated to Kerberos v5```
Then I tried to get an advisory from production but got some error like this:
```errata-tool advisory get 124911
Traceback (most recent call last):

So I guess we need to request for permission
[2023-12-04T15:17:58.800439] U04JV0JBEFM: but I would probably just use something like this: <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/osci/errata-automation/-/blob/master/errata_automation/errata.py?ref_type=heads#L401-404>
[2023-12-04T15:17:23.284899] U04JV0JBEFM: if you need a repo to grab an example out of, I would use the OSCI automation though it's changed quite a bit since I last looked at it: <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/osci/errata-automation>
[2023-12-04T15:06:00.636649] U04JV0JBEFM: <@U02DXVBD5CP> it's supposed to be, but the brew keytab required a lot of poking to get working. I would use <https://github.com/red-hat-storage/errata-tool> to create a simple script to auth/read an errata and print it out to see if the keytab is working

[2023-12-04T10:54:07.683289] U02DXVBD5CP: Yes, I saw it there so I was wondering if you already did everything. 
[2023-12-04T10:04:00.911559] U0171SJF00H: the keytab for it is also there
[2023-12-04T10:03:49.180499] U0171SJF00H: just checked, it's under `<http://errata.engineering.redhat.com/auto-toolchain-service-errata|errata.engineering.redhat.com/auto-toolchain-service-errata>`
[2023-12-04T09:58:22.967649] U0171SJF00H: I think we got one for errata as well
[2023-12-04T09:58:15.631489] U0171SJF00H: try checking our bitwarden vault for those
[2023-12-04T09:58:05.982279] U0171SJF00H: Hmm, <@U04JV0JBEFM> filed those requests a while back
[2023-12-04T09:51:44.202909] U02DXVBD5CP: <@U0171SJF00H> if I remember correctly, you requested service account keytab for errata along with brew’s key tab right? I was looking at how to request permission for errata as a team. To do that, I need to ask errata team to add permission to our errata’s key tab. Just want to confirm that you haven’t done it already (I tested the key tab and it seems to not have permission yet)
